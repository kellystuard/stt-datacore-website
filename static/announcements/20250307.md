## CAB ratings to be discontinued, note from Dangevin:

> Hey, all.

> It's with a heavy heart that I announce my retirement from CAB, CABtools and Star Trek Timelines.

> The decision is driven purely by external factors, I assure you all. This has been a great ride, and I'm happy to have played alongside you for as long as I was able!

> I'll be working on the CABtools for the next month to give Datacore time to release their own crew evaluation metric (currently in beta), however the website will no longer be updated with new crew from April forward. A Traveling Man may continue to host it for some time in its final state, however all good things...
