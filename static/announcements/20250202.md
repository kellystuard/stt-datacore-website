DataCore v2.3 is out! See everything that's new in the latest update.<!-- end -->

## What's New?

### Voyage Calculator Updates

#### New Voyage Home

The new voyage home view has 3 sections:

1) Current Voyages: a list of all viable voyages imported from player data, with the main voyage properties and statuses all visible at-a-glance.

2) Custom Voyage: you can create a custom voyage with manually-input skills and traits. This is also where you can now re-calculate a voyage that's already running (via a "presets" menu) or calculate crew from the entire game roster.

3) Voyage History: for tracking past voyages and most used crew.

#### New Voyage Lineup Editor

The voyage calculator has added the ability to edit a recommended lineup. Tap the pencil icon from the recommendation to launch the lineup editor, where you can seek alternate crew and see how they affect the lineup in various seats. Save as a new recommendation to see the lineup alongside other recommendations.

#### Improved Support for Encounter Voyages

Using the Multi-vector assault calculator, you can now get recommendations targeting a voyage lineup with your preferred balance of voyage runtime, event VP, and crew proficiency.

(PENDING TESTING) Adds an encounter helper. More details forthcoming.

### Prospective Quipment

New feature added to Voyage Calculator, Shuttle Helper, and Event Planner allows you to use these tools to view crew boosted by prospective quipment.
