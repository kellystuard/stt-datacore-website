A Voyage Exclusive crew from a two-parter, Lucien was an easy name to avoid until recently. His four Collection ceiling now makes him an easy target from your daily Voyages.

He clearly lacks in all other areas except for the possibility of a Trait Mega Event here and there where heâ€™ll probably be flying your thirteenth requisition Shuttle. You know what they say - the Devil finds work for idle hands.
