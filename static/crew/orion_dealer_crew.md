We’re 75% of the way to an all-Clint Howard Bridge Crew! If we could only get his Ferengi version from Enterprise or the grizzled Starfleet veteran from the Federation-Klingon War flashback episode of Strange New Worlds, we would be all the way there!

Ok, so they put Green Clint Howard in a Tuesday Pack. Blech. On the bright side, every new low-rarity Orion makes that tough Collection a little less tough, so you can wait him out until he’s in the Time Portal.

Oh, should we talk about the card itself? What’s to say? “Not bad for a Super Rare.”
