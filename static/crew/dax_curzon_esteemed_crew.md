“My God, stand him upright, take ten pounds off him, put him in a Chanel suit, and what have you got?” A Timelines Originals, apparently.

The quintessential case in why Traits matter, Curzon is lacking in the Gauntlet, on Ships, and on Voyages. But that kind of doesn’t matter in this case thanks to the other utility afforded him by his Traits.

Grandfathered (and we don’t use that phrase lightly considering his romantic exploits) into Dax Events, Curzon comes preloaded with established and reliable Event potential. And that’s even before getting any help from his Event-viable Traits of which he has four or five that haven’t shown up for work yet.

Perhaps they’ve been busy bumping up his Collection value instead. Already with a quintet, there’s certainly room for growth with a handful more of likely Collection traits waiting their turns. If he ever catches the Traits he’s missing via an audit (dude…c’mon guys), he would challenge the Spocks of the game as the most valuable Collection piece out there.
