Despite heralding the Royalty collection, WRG certainly didn’t roll out the red carpet for this Queen. Notable debut voyage power is severely blunted by a redundant skill set and that aforementioned collection is Deela’s first, though that number rarely remains static for crew.

Finding weekend work for her respectable CMD base is contingent on event one-offs and mega months which almost never exceed a week and a half of Faction Action. Deela will quickly slip into low-end collection speculation territory as a behold option, but will look absolutely fabulous doing it. Seriously, behold at least one copy for that gorgeous artwork.
