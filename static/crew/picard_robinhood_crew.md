Robin Hood has long had a reputation as big as his SEC Base and in the right situations can live up to it. Offering no non-Shuttle daily use, the more interesting point of focus is his Trait list.

As of now his Traits are mostly untapped, but look for Robin to hit a bullseye with up to a four spot of Collections one day, his episode Vanity notwithstanding.
