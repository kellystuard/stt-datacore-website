Giveaway crew are always tempting to cite for the perceived Honor save in not needing four Citations, but if you make that choice with this Picard, don't do it for his work on Voyages. CMD/DIP/SCI has been printed en masse as the new CMD/DIP/SEC and with debut Voyage power hanging out among even launch day cards, his shelf life in that area is short lived. Elsewhere, however, he's not bad. Picard has always lacked a strong CMD base, which is a role.....model..... that CPDP fills nicely. His body of Traits affords him four spots in Collections (three more could be in awaiting) while supplementing weekend Event bonuses. Not a complete package, but a fine 'toolbox' crew for many rosters and situationally worth the last-star-giveaway-tax. You can also safely snag your first copy to help your Fleet complete Fleet Boss Battle Nodes, as heâ€™s among the best solvers in the game.
