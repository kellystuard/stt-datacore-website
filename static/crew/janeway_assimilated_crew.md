No longer a voyager, Borgway can be thought of as a 2-skiller, except where Shuttle flexibility is concerned. That being said, she does excel at piloting on the weekends. Two huge spike years of seven Events for Janeway variants have pumped up an Event tally that is thick with Faction action. That sort of (re)usability makes her even more attractive as a Collection option as those stars won't go to waste. Slowly fuse her up as WRG slowly adds Collections that match her remaining unused Traits.
