Ok, I’m starting to see a theme here. Trek fans really liked the nostalgia of Picard Season 3, so the developers have decided to see if they’d put their money (and premium currency) where their mouth is… meaning Bridge Data, La Forge, and now Picard are ALL Tuesday Pack releases. Well, it’s a business and we can’t begrudge them for trying to Engage! our spending habits in this way, can we?

A Tier 1 Captain gets a Tier 1 Legendary variant, and this Bridge Picard may be worth every penny of imaginary or folding money you might choose to spend on his Pack. A Green Big Book Scorecard from left to right outside of Gauntlet (and they seem to reserve Gauntlet viability these days only for special crew like Exclusives), Picard is a strong upper-echelon Voyager, owing to the raw power and having a cute little ENG Tertiary to save him from CDS doldrums. 

Picard Events, common enough, will make use of his top two Skills, and a five spot of Collections with a sixth viable Trait in tow give him immediate impact on your Collections Tab. Also, if somehow you don’t have a 400% Instant Damage crew for your Ships with a 6s Activation, he can hop right into your setup.
