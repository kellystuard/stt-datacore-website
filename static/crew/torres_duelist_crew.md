Neither of Torres’ Bases are impressive and she may not even make Event Shuttles before four stars, but she also has a handful of possible one-off Event Traits and the Torres Event cushion. Those Traits also do their best to make her a Gauntlet-capable two-Skiller, however she sports two merely average rolls and will need both Skills to line up, meaning she often performs better on paper than in game. Despite a trio of 45% Gauntlets and one 65% set, Torres is a risky pick at best who’ll often find herself drowning in a sea of Tribbled Koloth and Korax.

Her Collection profile, at least, is worth noting and in concert with sporadic weekend work makes Torres a fine low-end dart throw in Legendary Beholds if you don’t mind long-term investments.
