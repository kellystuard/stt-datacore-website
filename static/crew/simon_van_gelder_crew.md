In the mold of, well, most voyage exclusive crew, SvG is a rare drop which reads “lose one crew slot or pay four citations”. Ok, maybe that’s a mind half empty way of looking at it, so let’s peruse the positives.

As a MED primary crew with usable voyage power, Captain Tracey starts off with a massive advantage over your average offering. As one of only three MED-led crew in the top 100 voyage ranks (fellow exclusive Chapel being another), his value over replacement in that area is staggering. Ample anti-matter seating cements an instant return on investment if you fully fuse him with citations instead of waiting thirty-five years for more copies from voyage beholds.

A five-pack of collections on release could balloon even higher as show collections continue to roll out and with a dark horse voyage exclusive collection to consider. His other offerings are a bit of on-paper value, however. Most rosters able to get their hands on SvG already have their Fleet Boss Battles lineup all set and a mix of low MED seating plus lack of event bonuses blunts a base rank which seems appealing at a glance.

Ultimately this is a card which will pay back its cost to immortalize if you do so early on, the hard part is really just getting him to drop.
