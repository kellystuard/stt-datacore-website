For starters, Dolorex easily has the best name of the three Betazoid intelligence operatives we meet aboard the Cerritos, so for that alone I am grateful. A girl who really knows how to party (please see her Vegas Strip-esque drink), does Cathiw have a point that she’s really more of a sanctimonious buzzkill? Let’s dig in.

Outside of the excellent art (I feel like I should be drinking while writing this. In fact, brb…), what are we working with here? We at the Big Book love Collections, and she’s only debuting with two! Total buzzkill. Upon closer inspection though, her huge trait list could deliver up to seven more one day, so it’s not all bad. Next up, Gauntlet. You’d think that as a lipstick stun baton wielding agent she’d have some use here, but nope. Buzzkillington. How about Ship Battle? Ooo, 400% Instant Damage? Meh, those crew are everywhere these days and she has a trigger? Cathiw may be onto something.

But wait, there’s more! Hope may not be lost after all if we take a look at her Voyage utility! Coming in nicely near the top of her Skill Pairing and Triplet (and behind Bridge Beverly Crusher, who you can only obtain through luck and patience via Voyages), this Antimatter Seat trait-heavy gal may have some fun to offer after all. Plus, that SEC Base will pair nicely with any Faction Event we see that ample trait list get picked from. Verdict: not great, not terrible. Methinks Cathiw may be projecting a bit of jealousy. I wonder what Katrot has to say?
