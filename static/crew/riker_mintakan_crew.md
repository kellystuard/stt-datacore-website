His Event history is rock solid on paper - ever-present SEC seating for Riker Events with a fistful of viable Traits for bonuses. Considering his dreary Voyage, Gauntlet, and Ship Ability power, he's best thought of as a luxury choice for late game players with more gas in the tank for weekends and reasonable Collection value.
