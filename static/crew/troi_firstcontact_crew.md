Drunk Troi is in the running for the worst variant for her cost, probably even down to the one star level. Flaccid stats everywhere except some average Arena numbers serve to pigeonhole her into Faction Event work. 

Even the always desirable MED Skill doesn't save her; for Voyages it sits behind two of her Super Rare variants and for Base it may require her to be Fully Fused to make an Event impact. While that wasn't an awful proposition for those who chose to buy her campaign long long ago, it can definitely be a daunting proposition if starting fresh. Even if you're desperate for MED, triple check your other Behold options before taking the Commander over useless or redundant options. Perhaps her only saving grace is that she *finally* has a Collection, and a Stat-Boosting one at that. We'll raise a shot of tequila to that.
