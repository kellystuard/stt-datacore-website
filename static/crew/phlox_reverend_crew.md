Repent, sinner! Or the minister may perform an exorcism on you with his osmotic eels. Phlox has earned the admiration of players due to his uncommon Skill set, but let’s not forget that it’s not 2018 anymore and his Voyage power has slipped away to time.

However, his uncommon Skill set also gives him a puncher’s chance in the Gauntlet when his Traits catch elevated Crit. MED/CMD walls of overpowered crew simply don’t exist (yet) and Phlox will often be able to 2-for-1 a single CMD or MED roll from your opponents. Not a choice for established rosters, but a great early game pickup to help you break into a competitive area of the game. 

Long term value includes the occasional Phlox Event, Trait-based Collections with their ceiling likely hit at three, and Trait-based Event bonuses as well.
