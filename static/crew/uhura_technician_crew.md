“We really want an Uhura with ENG”
(*~Monkey’s Paw curls…~*)
Here’s the first 5* Skillet since Regency Riker, and she’s in the Honour Hall!

One of the top 3 Technicians in-game, Uhura is absolutely rocking her jumpsuit. If you’re a sucker for good art like we are, you won’t be disappointed. However, 100,000 Honour (and 4 Cites) is a steep price to pay for someone who won’t Voyage or Gauntlet for you. Once upon a time it seemed like the Honour Hall was, well, an honour reserved for special crew, but now it seems like a place to simply drain Honour from min-maxers, collectors, and elderly players (some of whom are all of the above). It’s also worth noting that the last time a new Honour Hall crew dropped, an Honour Sale followed along closely, so perhaps this is a sign of things to come?

She is not without her merits however, as if you’re on Team BigBase™ she boasts the new #1 DIP score at time of launch, finally dethroning Prof Sato. With the TOS Bridge Crew Mega seemingly a one-off amidst many a Disco or trait Mega (unless the Discovery resurgence is a sign of things to come?), you’ll have to wait for those Uhura Events or maybe a Jury Rigger Mega. Her traits are tapped out Collection-wise unless TOS happens, but the ones she’s already in are all Stat-Boosting so there is some nice value to be found there. Where she will really shine is in Boss Battles, as she brings a 25% Hull Repair to the table that comes online in a speedy 6 seconds and provides an additional +1 ACC boost over current FBB hull repair meta mainstays Laborer Kirk and Mok’bara Crusher. Is this small upgrade worth the investment cost to you though, especially when we don’t know what the next season of FBB will bring? We’ll let the players decide for themselves.
