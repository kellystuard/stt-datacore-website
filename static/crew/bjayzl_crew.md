Bejaysus! Talk about cruel. Seriously, I can’t think of anyone who has earned the Brutal trait more than ol’ Ms. Double Fisting. Apparently she’s here to ruthlessly de-Borg Icheb and get drunk, and she’s all out of Icheb implants…

Vajazzle (don’t look this up at work) brings all sorts of glitter to Star Trek Timelines. Mounds of it. Shining on like a rhinestone cowboy, she’s an excellent addition to the Voyage ranks and a crew actually worthy of debuting in a Tuesday Pack (our usual warning on these packs aside). With decorative shoulders powerful enough to knock even a 1980s businesswoman down a peg, this Scrabble word nightmare uses her ENG tertiary to stake her place among the DIP/CMD elite. Heck, if that’s not enough for you, she gets a trait-based CMD boost thanks to her “Merchant” Quipment, for when you really want to go all out. A DIP base that will Event for you thanks to an extensive trait list is the icing on the cake. Or sparkles on a…you know what, ask your mother.
