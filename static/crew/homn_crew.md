Quiet…patient…caring…hell of a drinker…these are just a few of Mr. Homn’s many redeeming qualities. But can he redeem himself in Timelines?

Unfortunately, no. As a Super Rare the only hope is usually Collections, maybe some niche Gauntlet, and early roster Voyage utility. Well, there’s no Gauntlet here, and a Ship Ability that’s slower and less powerful than Ardra’s. Almost everyone has a few Collections these days, though at least he has potential for a few more (can he go 6/6?!). The one bright spot, besides his charming smile and the fact that we finally got him in game? The occasional Voyage appearance may be in store thanks to being a unicorn in his skill set at this rarity level, something Nightmare Mode™ nutters may find helpful but “normal” players will quickly move past.
