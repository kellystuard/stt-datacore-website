ðŸŽµGaila, you've got me on my knees.
Gaila, I'm begging, darling, please.
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?ðŸŽµ

Are you from one of those families that always compares you to the others? No matter what you do, itâ€™s not enough because cousin Bill is a Doctor? Well, move over Bill, because cousin Gaila owns his own frigginâ€™ moon!

As luck would be it for all the underappreciated children out there, this particular moon-owner is all style and little substance. Oh sure, he has some Voyage utility for now thanks to a somewhat barren skill triplet, but thatâ€™s a passing fad just like Grandma claimed your degree in Russian Literature was! And fine, he has a +11 Attack Boost in Ship Battles, but is that really any more notable these days than the struggling brewery you opened in the hip, gentrified neighbourhood across town? When you were both 12 you totally kicked his ass in Gauntlet anyway, so what does he have to be smug about?
