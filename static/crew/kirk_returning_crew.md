We here at the BigBook have a confession to make: we love porn. Um, sorry, STARSHIP porn. Please, this is a family business.

Returning Kirk is to Timelines as the Enterprise reveal scene is to The Motion Picture: We didn’t know we wanted it, we now KNOW we need it, and by god we’re willing to part with our own honour just to have a taste! As it turns out, that would be Honour in this case, as we welcome a new addition to the Honour Hall. Unlike other members, however, Kirk has the Hall ‘returning’ (get it?) to its glorious self.

A Voyager who tops both his main pairing AND his complete skillset, Kirk is everything you could want and more. Events? Check. Collections? Check. Shuttle use? Check again. Surely that’s enough for you? Oh wait, +12 Attack Boost in Ship Battles?! Is there anything he can’t do? Admittedly, ya…Gauntlet is the one thing you won’t find yourself trying him out on. Of course, two and a half years as head of Starfleet Operations may have made him a little stale, but we wouldn’t exactly consider him untried.
