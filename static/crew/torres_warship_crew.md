Hey guys, did you want a unicorn Skill set with enough raw power to make good use of it? Did you want it to be MED-Primary? Did you also want a fun little Ship Ability as a bonus?

Ok, here you go! Warship Torres! A Timelines’ Original since Roxann Dawson didn’t actually appear in VOY: Warship, she gets the small benefit of that Vanity Collection, plus a trio of Stat-Boosting Collections, and a duo of untapped Traits still in reserve. A top-rated Voyager with zero real peers, not even distantly in her rearview mirror, she gets the Big Book of Behold Advice Instacite Stamp of Approval:™:!
