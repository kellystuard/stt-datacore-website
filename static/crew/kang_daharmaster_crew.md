There's something to be said for crew who exceed the sum of their parts. A Collection spot, for example, is worth more if it's attached to someone that you can use in other places. A Klingon, for example, is worth that much more if they hit on another big Collection. So it is with Kang whose five Collections push him into being something of a value pick.

Collection fanatics may be doing double takes at Kang and that's a reasonable thought to have if you're in the later parts of your Timelines journey with a slot on your Crew Retrieval list or a lucky Legendary Behold in front of you.
