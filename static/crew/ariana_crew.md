Literally three lines of dialogue. This is what the devs can do when they care to put in the effort. If you’re looking for excellent overall card power, this isn’t it, but Ariana is bursting with traits and flavor with enough base power and a serviceable skill set to elevate her into option territory for a few different game systems. If you’re a TNG season 1 fanatic (be gone, demon) or a child of the 80’s who’s happy to revisit some early season schmaltz, the devs have given you enough justification to star up an otherwise mid-level crew.
