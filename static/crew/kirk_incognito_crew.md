As his scorecard suggests, Incognito is a freeze and forget, but despite his name, you may have trouble with the second half of those instructions.

Oodles of Kirk Events, many of them Factions, await any qualified Super Rare with viable Bases. As a strong Super Rare CMD option for those weekends, Incognito is a fine thaw whose Shuttle-friendly Bases will often ride before a theoretically stronger option in a less-represented seat. His limitations are obvious, but thereâ€™s no risk of a tumble into total irrelevance when it comes to Shatner - the Rock. It. Man.
