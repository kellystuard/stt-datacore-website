Ok, who remembers this guy? Thereâ€™s not much here for this Event reward, apart from an interesting combination of Traits that could result in a quintet of Collections once they are all realized. SEC Bases are a dime a dozen, and without an interesting Ship Ability, Gauntlet prowess, or even enough Voyage power to make use of an interesting Skill set which is duplicated and improved upon by Honor Hall Burnham and Campaign Reward Detmer, Cankle Durr is perhaps an easy skip from Event rewards or Event Packs.
