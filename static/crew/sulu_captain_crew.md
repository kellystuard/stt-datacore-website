Craptain Sulu somehow managed to be featured crew twice without his variants being bonus. The Captain's Oath Re-run tried to fix that (and failed), but Suluâ€™s variant Event tally still sits miles away from double digits and his daily value is in the tank. If you take this crew, it should be for his thin Collection value and chances for another big bonus feature.
