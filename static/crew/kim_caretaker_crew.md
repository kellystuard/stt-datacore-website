Little known fact, Dave Chappelle was referencing Caretaker Kim in his famous PopCopy skit. CMD/DIP/SUCK crew are allowed to have top voyage numbers. But if you’re a MED/ENG or equally rare skill set, we have to deduct a hundred voyage ranks right off the bat. "Why? Why treat the customer this way? ‘Cause fuck ‘em, that’s why!"

Kim’s unique skill order among all crew could have set him up for all-star, eternal voyage glory with the right power level. Little did he know that Kathryn Janeway handles crew ””balance”” for Timelines.

Doubtless, Kim will find day one work on voyages and the occasional event due to that unique voyage ability and a fairly consistent variant event clip, but his debut metrics are clearly aligned to tank harder and faster over time than your other citation projects. With half of his traits being painfully generic and encompassing massive pools of crew, don’t expect them to bail out his value via collections or extra events in years to come.
