It would be difficult to see any future Mayweathers eclipse the brief suge of rockstar popularity that his MACO variant enjoyed around the release of Fleet Boss Battles, but Swoleweather tries his best.

His disappointingly pre-aged voyage rank at least doesnâ€™t have much competition. Joining Corrupted Badgey as the only two crew in the top 150 vRanks as of his debut, Travis may find his way into some niche seating longer than his surface level metrics would suggest. Similarly on the weekend, despite the Mayweather lineage only snagging about one event yearly, his traits have done some real work to flesh out an event history that you might peg as a Riker or McCoy in a blind tasting.

Joining his recently released compatriot Goofy Windbreaker Archer in the six collection club makes Travis a tempting target for endgame players just looking to stack stat boosts, while his fast, triggerless shipboard damage is fine for new players to grab one star of. Despite artist #2 deeply underselling how jacked Anthony Montgomery is, this crew ranks easily among the best Mayweathers ever printed.
