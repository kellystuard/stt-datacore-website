Offering something for everyone, Mariner’s Mom has this author doing the Fry squint at her Tier score. Great front-loaded Collection value makes her a must have for elderly players, while requisite daily power on Voyages and Shuttles make her a fine early game event acquisition for desperate newer rosters.

With Vindicta Mariner turning the Ship Battle world on its head, it’s worth noting that Freeman’s +9 Attack Boost has the same Initialization time and subsequent Activations. They would make a fun pair to ride together as she has the same Cycle as her daughter. Please don’t use the previous sentence in any other context ever ever ever ever.
