One of the crew that messes with Behold Bots since she’s crouching, Runaway Po enjoys a solid all around pedigree (for now). Still viable on Voyages until you acquire some higher Rarity crew, Po has a sextet of Collections including her hidden “dsc” Trait, and all those nice Traits give her viability with a bevy of Trait-based weekend bonuses.
