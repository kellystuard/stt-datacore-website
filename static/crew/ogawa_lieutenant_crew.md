Every once in a while WRG prints a crew that makes you stop and stare. Lt. Ogawa was one of those crew, given her incredible debut Voyage power and delectable unicorn Skill set. While her power has waned, as it does with all crew over time, she still remains Voyage viable if you’ve come into all her stars at once. No longer a crew you want to build from the ground up, since stronger crew in her triplet have since been released AND entered the Time Portal, Alyssa can at least provide a slot in two Collections and has at least one more viable Trait set aside for later. 

You won’t find her making any variant Events given the character’s minor recurring role (she’s no Garak), but her MED-led Skill set would allow you to put her on the rare MED Shuttle seat if her name is called for a Physician Event.
