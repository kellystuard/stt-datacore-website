A DIP primary La’an? You can almost hear her bristling from here. With a lot of bloated traits and few collections, this may seem like a good crew to toss overboard if your crew slots are bursting at the seams, but keep in mind that she has no unique retrieval combinations and you may end up fishing for her for quite a while when on the precipice of one of her collection milestones.

She’ll also be rock solid on event bonus weekends thanks to a skill set perfectly crafted for typical shuttle seating. Her voyage power is a bit of a smokescreen given how common her skills are, but new players picking up multiple copies from her debut event will still be able to employ her there or as a fast activating shipboard option before she inevitably hits the freezer.
