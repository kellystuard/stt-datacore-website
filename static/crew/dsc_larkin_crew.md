No in-jokes here, Larkin’s Trek short was a steaming pile and I’ll fight anyone who says differently.

Which means that Larkin’s card pretty much fits, then. A Skill set attractive to new players is mired in lousy Voyage power thanks to his Grebnedlog-esque Tertiary and while Discovery Mega Events will never quite reach the heights of 2017-2019, his Trait list is not lacking for opportunities for weekend work.

His Traits also do provide his most notable value spot; Collections. He’s pretty much a required Immortalization for the Tribbled set, and with a strong ceiling of six, he’s a solid Behold choice once you’ve turned your attention to global Stat Boosts over daily use in your Super Rare crew.
