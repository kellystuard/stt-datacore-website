Buckle your seatbelts, Roger Carmel is finally in the game! We’re belting it from the rooftops! And as a giveaway crew, you won’t have to spend a single laddybuck to acquire him. So glad that whomever held the rights to his likeness finally buckled and allowed this wonderful character to join Timelines. I’m sure you’d like us to buckle down and talk stats, but the mere mention of “cmd/dip” or “ranks” would be hitting below the belt.
