It's a relatively safe bet to say that Mr. Shape of Water has peaked - his two best Collection chances have hit and Discovery Mega Events may presumably be finished despite a recent resurrection. While Saru has gotten a shocking amount of event work from those two little Traits in the time since, one would expect their summer seasons to cool as well. Still a worthwhile Super Rare to choose from a Behold for the aforementioned reasons, just not one likely to increase in value any time soon.
