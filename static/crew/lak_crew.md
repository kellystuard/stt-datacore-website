Looking a bit like a Krill from “The Orville”, we finally got to learn what’s under a Breen Refrigeration Suit. Are some things better left a mystery? Not sure I can look at Thot Gor the same way again…

What he L’aks in visual appeal, he at least offers in Fusibility? That’s right, aside from some slightly viable Voyage use for new players, most will only want to L’ak and Load him into their roster to fuse with a copy of Moll, as they combine to create one of the best characters in the game.
