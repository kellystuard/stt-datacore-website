Arav is that dependable background alien, always noticeable amidst the sea of interchangeable humanoid faces. She appeared in all five seasons of Disco and rose to the rank of Lieutenant, and I bet most of you are just learning her name. Or that she’s a her. But if you’ve watched the show you’ve at least noticed her.

You know where you won’t notice her? In your Timelines Crew Quarters, once you freeze and forget. That is of course unless you’re a new player or Nightmare Mode™ cognoscente, in which case she’s actually got some Voyaging power by Super Rare standards. For the rest of us though, as always, enjoy the extra tick in some of your Collections and put Arav into the background, where she has already proven she thrives.
