So this is what we’ve come to. Clip show crew. At least Geordi’s Maverick Trait may earn him some cachet with the ladies.

Voyages are the name of the game here; a unique Skill order among Super Rares and excellent Antimatter chances make La Forge a juicy acquisition for players in the early-to-midgame. He’s serviceable but unexceptional elsewhere with a strong ENG Base mopping up the rest of the headlines. La Forge is flush with that Skill at the Legendary level and it doesn’t appear a ton in Faction Event seats, but there’s still average or better long term value here once the Voyage dust settles.
