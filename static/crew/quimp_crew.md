Fun fact: When not trapping himself in a perpetual cycle of self-sabotage and immature rebellion, Quimp lives in a pineapple under the sea. Seriously. Look it up.

In addition to his expected demands for profit, Quimp demands Collections. While the barrier for entry may be a bit expensive in terms of price (a Tuesday Pack) or time (eventual entry into the Portal), you’ll find that the interest pays off in spades. Or in bars of latinum. Or whatever the hell the card suits in Tongo are. Semantics aside, he enters the game with six of them, all Stat-Boosting, and has a shot at up to four more. Suddenly that predatory loan doesn’t seem so bad…
