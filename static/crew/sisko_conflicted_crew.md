“Whisko” has ceased to be an option on Voyages for some time, but he retains some fringe use in the Gauntlet when his Traits achieve a Crit bonus. You might even see him slapping around CMD/SEC juggernaut Exclusives if RNG behaves. 

As with most Siskos, Conflicted has a bevy of Traits which are certain to eventually get their number called for Collections and those same traits help him be a solid Node solver in Fleet Boss Battles, so he’s a worthwhile long term investment from the first copy. Even at a single star his SEC base will help you staff those common Shuttle seats.

Beyond that, there should be ample event opportunities for this main cast captain, including a handful of theoretically eventable traits. Those same traits promise to make him a collection horse as the game's lifespan approaches infinity, though it may take a while for the wheel of fortune to spin through all of them.
