Do we vouch for this Vulcan? Do we recommend this Romantic? Do we stan Stonn?

Well…no offence Spock, but sort of, ya.

By no means a must-have, this SEC/SCI (pronounced “sek-see”) prison guard is more than just a piece of T’Pring’s eye candy. A Voyager who will punch about his rank thanks to his skill order and trait set, he’ll have some staying power even as new potential paramours enter the game. Combine that with an Event friendly trait set (which brings with it three Stat-Boosting Collections and the hope of four or five more) and place in a currently airing Trek Show, and you’ll find him a useful, but not required, addition to your roster.
