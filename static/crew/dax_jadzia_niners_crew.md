Ready to throw the ceremonial first pitch for the Timelines’ Originals Mega Event, from-beyond-the-grave Niners Jadzia somehow hops ahead of still-missing Niners Nog, O’Brien, Quark, Jake, Kasidy, and Bashir in line for inclusion in the game. 

Debuting on the edge of Voyage viability despite a plus SEC/SCI-led Skill set, the real value here is in the septet of Collections, including that notably Jadzia was the first-ever Playful crew. Granted, two of the Collections are Vanity, but even having ONLY five Stat-boosting entries is above average. 

Oddly enough, this crew is missing her hidden “dax” crew identifier so her Event history seems wonky, but if that gets fixed and we see her qualify for presumptive variant Dax Events, her big SEC Base will pitch in all weekend.
