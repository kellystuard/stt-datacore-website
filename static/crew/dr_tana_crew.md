The first Lower Decks crew in game, and a MED/CMD option at that, had everyone all aflutter and declaring T’Ana the greatest thing ever. Luckily we’re here for a more objective viewpoint and, mostly, to rain on a few parades.

T’Ana is indeed a plus value ‘screwdriver’ crew for those tricky MED/CMD Voyages. A near power refresh of fellow M.D. Pollard, this furrier version will likely not Voyage outside of that specific combination due to sagging power.

It’s otherwise slim pickings for statistical highlights. T’Ana’s strong MED Base is hamstrung by the scarcity of MED seating and her Traits aren’t all that viable for Events. It’s not outside the realm of possibility that her character receives many future variants and/or Lower Decks show Mega Events, but until they come to fruition, we find it hard to recommend her Shuttle abilities as much more than the cherry on top.

Her Collection profile will remain below average thanks to that Thin trait set and a unique two second activation Evasion ability on Ships doesn’t provide enough boost to be a difference maker in most cases. The dearth of MED/CMD gives the doc all of her statistical luster, and even that is fading fast.
