Sam Kirk might just be the new Bradward Boimler; three variants released and not a single one Legendary. Fleegmanesque, this Tuesday Time Portal Pack release is the bland variant standing in his uniform without a prop, food, drink, chair, weapon, hat, and he isn’t pointing. He has some Crit Damage on Ships though. Ok, but seriously. As Super Rares go, he makes a strong case to stay on your Voyages into the midgame with power and Skill set combined, but as an early game player, please don’t splash in six packs for Super Rares! In 12-18 months he’ll be in the Time Portal and by then, he may still be pretty good.
