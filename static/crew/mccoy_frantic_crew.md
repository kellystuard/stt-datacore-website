You bet players will be frantic to acquire the seventh blue uniform Bones clone, because this time Barbie has a hat! He wears the Gauntlet and Voyage hats, to be specific, and does so with aplomb.

Wielding Gauntlet power that apparently only Exclusive Crew are allowed to have these days, McCoy has a hefty overall Proficiency with a plus Skill set to boot. He steals the CMD/DIP crown from Gauntlet Exclusive Balok and offers enough in the MED/CMD space to grant him fantastic versatility. He’s not as Crit-happy as most recent Gauntlet additions, but is a steady hand who will see a ton of action on rosters of any level.

He’s a Voyage natural too, thanks again to a plus Skill set and heady Antimatter rate. Calculators may not favor his high Proficiency percentage so feel free to seat him manually as your Voyage construction allows. Peaking early for Collections, Bones may ultimately stop at four-ish, but comes out of the box with good value there too.

As the only +12 Attack Boost option in the game currently, McCoy hits home runs in several areas and should see play all over the field for years to come.
