We all thought Elizabeth Shelby ought to have gotten a better variant from her TNG appearance in TBOBW, and the developers surely disappointed us a second time by making her Picard version… also a Super Rare. Well, at least this one isn’t a skillet, and has some early game Voyage power, but what else has she got? Two Collections, maybe one more viable Trait, and a lackluster Instant Damage Ability? Well, maybe we’ll get a better Shelby next time.
