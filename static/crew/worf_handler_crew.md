ðŸŽµAuto, can you handle this?
Idol, can you handle this?
Big, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this!ðŸŽµ

No, I donâ€™t believe anyone can handle the finely aged glory that is Handlerâ€¦BAH GAWD, THATâ€™S STARS AND GARTERSâ€™ MUSIC!

Worficianados rejoice, this majestic iteration of Michael Dornâ€™s timeless Security Chief cum-Starfleet Intelligence subcontractor is making his Timelines debut, something youâ€™ve all no doubt been wishing for the second the Picard Season 3 trailers dropped. And fear not, for heâ€™s here to deliver.

The second ever Worf with ENG, he also carries the second highest SEC and second highest DIP of all variants at time of launch. This firmly ensconces him as a top option in his skillset and traits for whatever your Voyage may throw at you, fitting for a man who has seen so much of the galaxy after all these years. And donâ€™t let his claims of pacifism fool you, Riker, Worf still knows his way around a Tactical Station with a whopping +16000 to Crit Bonus for Ship Battles! If youâ€™ve yet to unlock that pesky Demo Man Scotty, Worf is the next best thing coming online only 2 seconds slower. He further adds to his Houseâ€™s honour via those aforementioned bases, which along with his super reliable name and racial trait will mean countless Event appearances in the years to come. Nowhere near maxed out on Collections (2 Stat-Boosting ones for now, but perhaps 4 more down the line), heâ€™s an investment in your today and tomorrow, so donâ€™t hesitate to fight for a copy (or jump at the chance to get him in a future BeGold).
