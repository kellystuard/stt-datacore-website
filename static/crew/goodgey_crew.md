Released in the Ubercampaign, Goodgey may be considered among the best to be introduced via this release mechanism. A solid ENG-led Skill set with Voyage power to boot may draw the eye initially, then you might slide over to a set of four Collections and a Trait list with a little juice left for the future. But the main attraction might be in his Ship Ability, wherein TPG has finally broken the mold and released a 25% Hull Repair crew with a less than 20s Cycle Time, with Goodgey coming in at 18s. A best-in-class Attack Boost (for a Hull Repair Crew) lets you easily slot him into your Fleet Boss Battles quartet and will make it easier and easier to time out the Doomsday Machine. If youâ€™re apt to spend on the game but only sometimes, you might consider this Ubercampaign a good(gey) value.
