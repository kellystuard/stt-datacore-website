In a quick turnaround from the release of Masquerade/CPAP Data in the Honor Hall, Superhero Pose Burnham, aka Out of Time Burnham may have broken the streak of subpar DISHonor Hall crew! A solid set of Traits, with associated Collection bonuses and Event chances, are paired with futuristic Voyage power and a Skill order that would make even Michael blush. A worthy inclusion in the new Maverick Collection, the only place Michael doesn’t shine is in the Gauntlet, but everywhere else she’s a star! Granted the elderly player does not need yet another 400% Instant Damage crew on Ships, but if you wouldn’t mind swapping her in for an older crew that has led a good life, sure, why not?! Worth 100,00 Honor and four Legendary Citations? Well, that’s up to you, but there aren’t many better candidates if you opt for an Honor Hall buy.
