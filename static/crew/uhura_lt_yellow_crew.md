An ultimately replaceable cadet option, Nyota only claims cadet work one day per week and has no daily peripherals in the form of arena, gauntlet, or voyages. A shuttle stuffer, she even takes a bit of a hit from her Common variant which is the only other cadet who hits both of their stat-boosting collections while being far cheaper to immortalize. You’ll want to level her at some point, but it doesn’t need to be until you have other areas of your roster in order.
