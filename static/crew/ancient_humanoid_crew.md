If mom tells you we have Ancient Humanoid at home and tries to stick you with Changeling Founder, don't listen! With an original debut atop the SCI Base ranks and an upper echelon Voyager, time has slowly sapped her utility. Salome Jens’ pre-Founder role can still bring it on Shuttles and on Voyages some of the time, which is really all we want from a crew, outside of a meaty Trait list.

Ancient Humanoid parlays a quintet of Traits into a trio of Collections, while still enjoying two further viable Traits for future payoffs, one more viable than the other (Hologram Collection WHEN, WRG?!). A one-off character won’t of course have variant Events, but four of the five Traits have had Event bonuses or Mega Events, so look for those to reoccur, as WRG are creatures of habit.
