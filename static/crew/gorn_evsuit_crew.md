You, the reader, are to blame for this card! Well, only if you were on that TPG Live Stream on YouTube when they asked the chat to help them create the latest Continuum Missions Legendary reward. 

So, here you have him, EV Suit Gorn! Stellar art, and Gauntlet prowess to match. With no less than 45 elevated Crit sets, Gorny will perform well when he’s added to your top five, but oddly he shares a Skill set and order with former Exclusive Omet'iklan, but doesn’t do it as well. But, if you’ve been unlucky and don’t have yourself a Jem’hadar powerhouse, Gorn is a good surrogate. 

Did you get yourself four copies from Continuum Missions? Well, consider a Citation to finish him! Five Collections including the tough Primal makes him a solid candidate, and that opens up Quipment options for the future Goyage™ Events and Gauntlet itself.
