There’s an unwritten rule of thumb - if a crew can’t be 100% Retrieved, they’re probably not useful enough to get excited about. That’s not totally true in Ed’s case, but it surely does point to his aging profile and what sort of value you can expect long term.

Now that his Voyage power has waned almost to nothing, and with the totality of this value being tied to the Exobiology trait, there’s no shame in prioritizing different crew with a boring Skill set if their long term benefits beat out adding early stars onto Ed.
