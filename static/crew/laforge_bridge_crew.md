The latest entry into the “Bridge <insert crew name>” set from Season 3 of Picard, Bridge La Forge comes to us via a Tuesday Pack as a power refresh over now-faded former power crew like Angel Burnmom and Tactical Stamets, and with enough Anti-Matter seats on Voyages to grant you a bonus nearly every time. When La Forge Events come around, his SEC Primary and ENG Secondary should ride your Shuttles, but don’t look for him to pick up many more Collections outside of his debut trio. Pump the brakes on your nostalgia and consider a pass on his Tuesday Pack; the Commodore may not be worth your premium currency.
