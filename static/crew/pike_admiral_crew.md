“Your first pony was named ‘Sir Neighs-alot’” This is the kind of world building and character backstory that we nerds (yes, you’re a nerd dear reader, you’re reading fan created content for a mobile Star Trek game) live for. It was simply a matter of when, not if, we got (*Spoiler Alert*) Alternate Future Balance of Terror Pike in the game, and he’s here in all his Anson Mount-y glory.

Extra Long Monster Maroon Strap for No Reason Pike was a surprise, and it turns out accidental, entry into an Elusive Treasures pack on debut, but WRG has nonetheless added his talents to the cryovault all the same. However, and whenever, you find yourself with the chance to pick up a copy, you’ll be doing so with the knowledge that you’ll have a BigBase™ Boy on your hands. We caution you again that Base skills are fleeting: with a few exceptions, today’s flashy new Event Shuttle rider is tomorrow’s yawn fest. However, he will presumably get plenty of use thanks to his currently running (and I hope this is true no matter what year you’re reading this in) TV show.

Voyage use may be harder to come by as he’s buried behind a number of people in the all-too-bloated DIP/CMD pairing (the SCI kicker does little to help here), however those without deeper, more elderly rosters will find him a welcome addition to their lineup.

That is, unfortunately, all there is to him. Well, that and being an excellent addition to the Monster Maroon bridge lineup club.
