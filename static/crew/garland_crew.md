Faith (no Enterprise jokes, please) is a one hit wonder, but what a hit. Maybe the ultimate Gauntlet stepping stone at the Super Rare level, her safety blanket MED roll features a huge minimum score and she has enough 25% Crit sets to keep purchasing her entrance into your starting five even as your roster grows. With Bartender Guinan as the least ubiquitous Gauntlet Exclusive card, Faith's MED/DIP pair should have no trouble finding two-for-one opportunities or at least picking on weaker competition.
In most cases it's fine to stop at one star for this crew. Garland does have a trio of viable Collection Traits, but her Bases are not suitable for Event shuttles.
