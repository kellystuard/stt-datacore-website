Let's earn copies of Moll, everybody!
ðŸŽµScrew the erigah, fight for glory,
Let's Event for Moll, you won't be sorry.
Grab your jelly boyfriend,
And your cool leather coat,
With your Moll, having fun is what it's all about.ðŸŽµ

Looking more like Robin Daggers than Robin Sparkles, Moll slides into Timelines as a Mega Recurring reward. Disco isnâ€™t dead, it was just sleeping! Sheâ€™ll put her vast experience as a courier to good use thanks to, yep, another BigBaseâ„¢ SEC entry that pips the newly released Qâ€™Mau Burnham by a single point. Always one step ahead, that damned Moll.

One way we judge value in these Mega Recurring Crew is to see how they may serve us after their four week featured stretch is over. Will you want to add the final star? Will she still be desirable by the time she hits the Portal? Will Namer ever take me up on my standing offer to hot tub and chill? For Moll, at least, thereâ€™s a chance. 

That SEC score isnâ€™t going anywhere, so with ten total traits to her name Event work will always be in the cards. Voyage work can be found from time to time as well (couriers need to take whatever jobs come their way) thanks to her helpful ENG Secondary. Lastly, a few of her untapped traits are just begging to be given Collections, and as you know we here at the BigBook love Collections so much that nothing like a simple blood bounty could ever stop us from bringing *that* up. So go ahead, Event for Moll. You wonâ€™t be sorry.
