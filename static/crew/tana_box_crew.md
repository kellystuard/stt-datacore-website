Hey Timelines Player,
We got somethin' real important to give you.
So just sit down and listen.

ðŸŽµNow you know we've been together such a long long time.
(Such a long time)
And now weâ€™re ready to lay it on the line.
Wow, you know it's Tuesday and our packs are open wide.
(Open wide)
Gonna give you something so you know what's on our mind.
(What's on our mind)

A crew real special, so take off the top.
Take a look inside, it's a cat in a box.
It's in a box.

Not gonna get you a Gauntlet king;
That sort of crew don't mean anything.
Not gonna help you to Voyage far;
Please, ya gotta know you're my shinin' star.

Not gonna get your Event seats filled;
Accounts like yours need somethin' real.
Wanna get you somethin' from the heart;
Somethin' special now.

It's a cat in a box.
A cat in a box babe.
It's a cat in a box.
Ooh, a cat in a box girl.

See weâ€™re wise enough to know
When a crew needs givin', and we got just the one.
Somethin' to show ya that you are second to none.

To the developers out there with players to impress,
It's easy to do, just follow these steps:
1, draw a lid on a box.
2, put your cat in that box.
3, make â€˜em open the box.
And that's the way you do it.

It's a cat in a box.
A cat in a box babe.
It's a cat in a box.
Ooh, a cat in a box girl.

Christmas, cat in a box.
Prixin, cat in a box.
Kal Rekk, a cat in a box.
Every single holiday a cat in a box.
Over in a Tuesday Pack, a cat in a box.
Mid-day on the Dabo Wheel, a cat in a box.
One day as a Behold choice, a cat in a box.

A cat in a box.
A cat in a box.
A cat in a box.ðŸŽµ
