Captain Proton has a reputation for his torturous build cost consisting of 132 basic holoprograms, dozens of other faction items, and piles of components that may as well be made of latinum. Which is probably just as well since he offers nothing of worth for newer players aside from optional arena evasion. His mid-level collection value and a number of past big bonus event features make him worth the project later on, but he doesnâ€™t need to be a leveling (or behold) priority.
