We’ll never say no to more James Cromwell, and we aren’t starting now! Three, count ‘em, three, Legendary Cochrane variants, and notedly not the one who looks like Connor Trinneer from TOS. Yes, watch the episode and tell me I’m wrong.

They gave Zef a strong Skill set, but not enough of the power to make it go. Maybe he’ll go Warp 5 or so, but no faster. The bright spot of this card is in his Collection prowess, with five to start and Traits for more lined up behind them. So if you’re going to Fuse him up early, do it for the Trait list and enjoy some fringe Voyage use while it lasts.
