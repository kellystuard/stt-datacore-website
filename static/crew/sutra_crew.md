In an alternate universe Sutra teams up with Pussy Galore to run surveillance for the suave British MI6 agent Felix Leiter as he cuts down Oddjob on his way to foiling Auric Goldfinger's plot and the bumbling American agent James Bond causes countless international incidents. Well, I guess some things hold true in any universe.

In our universe, Sutra is primarily Collection fodder with an outside chance for growth in that area. While Event work will be Trait-dependent and inconsistent, her Traits have paid off in spurts thus far. With SEC and CMD seats littering Faction Shuttles regularly, she should be worth the Merits to thaw when the opportunities arise. Sutra has probably hit her ceiling with three Collections until TPG is scraping the bottom of the barrel in the twilight of the game.
