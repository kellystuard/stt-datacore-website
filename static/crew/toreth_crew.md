On the heels of the maligned episode that was Aquiel comes, thankfully, Face of the Enemy. This is arguably A top Troi episode and THE top Toreth episode (*Jenos hears his name on the wind*). A top five Carolyn Seymour episode too: this actress has impressively played four characters over five episodes/two series. Despite that level of on-screen representation, it’s only her first representation on our mobile devices.

Toreth will take a Command primary role on your Voyages much as she did aboard the IRW Khazara. Unfortunately, the occasional Rakal-esque authority (though not actually Rakal Troi, please don’t ever seat her on your Voyages) will step in and prevent her from being truly dominant. In a world of CMD Primary and CMD/SEC pairing crew, those such as Toreth are relegated to specific AM Trait seating or use when your top dogs are out Eventing. Fret not, however, as those traits will also offer some use on Faction Event Shuttles from time to time. Throw in four Stat-Boosting Collections and a chance at a couple more one day, and you’ve got a respectable crew who has some use for both early adopters and those naturally immortalising her over many future BeGolds.
