He's no dung beetle, in fact Jodmos is pretty far from poop. An event and shuttle stalwart in the early game, this Sisko variant blooms again post-cryo, especially in the eyes of veteran players.

His current collection cornucopia is enough justification for automatic behold status on endgame rosters, while his traits provide room for growth in that area and also supplement Sisko’s main cast status on the weekend, pushing him into top shelf event crew territory. Don’t be put off by his unremarkable skill set, it’s exactly what you want for shuttle work and makes Jodmos a prime crew for players of any level to target.
