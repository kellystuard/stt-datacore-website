One of two Legendary Torreses… (Torrii?) released into the game in quick succession, Orbital Skydiving Torres debuted prior to Barge of the Dead Torres, so she’s technically the older sister, but Barge is the big sister. 

Not that OST is bad, but she’s had her spotlight stolen, despite a sparkling Skill set and order, and enough power still to make it work on Voyages, at least for a bit longer, roster dependent. No longer really an “Instant Cite” candidate or a strong option to build from the ground up via Crew Retrieval, Torres has the banana pancakes to be a long-term value. A strong SEC Base for variant and Trait-based Events, you’ll find her contributions on the weekend well above average, and her Trait list will likely bear the fruit of a quintet of Collections one day. Safety protocols off!
