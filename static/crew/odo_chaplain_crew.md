M*A*S*H*ed together from bits of old Stranded Odo, the good Father has some reasonable Event work to his name, including a few big bonus features. His daily work is pretty fictitious at this point, though a long list of non-bloated Traits makes Chaplain an extremely interesting proposition in the midst of WRG's monthly Collection content trainâ„¢. 

The pie in the sky, moon shot, best case scenario outcome for this card could feasibly be seven Collections. That said, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush - opt for crew who can help you now or have real Collections, not just the ones we hope for.
