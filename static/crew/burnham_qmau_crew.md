"If there's a bright centre to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from." Q’Mau is a remote planet with vast canyons in the Jundland Wastes. Some of the native life forms on Q’Mau include Tusken Raiders, Jawas, and H…old on. Damnit Google AI!

Assassin’s Creed Burnham leaps off of her sand runner and into Timelines with an extra Collection in tow, thanks to “Deep Cover” finally recognizing the often unsung efforts of those skilled in the clandestine arts. She’s also heavily armed, sporting the now *7th* use of this specific BigBase™ SEC value that is still technically Top 5 overall (tied for third at time of writing)...Copy+Paste much? This repetition comes with pros and cons: you have another weapon in your arsenal when it’s time for Faction Events, giving you much better trait coverage, but you’re also adding to a log jam of Voyage and daily Shuttle options who can all be somewhat swapped in and out with no difference. Who am I to complain about variety though?! This almost makes the game customisable without having to make huge sacrifices…

Even if she is somewhat interchangeable, Burnham will absolutely Voyage for you given the chance. More than enough traits to find a seat if she’s not off Eventing, this crew is another weapon in your arsenal that’s designed more for the MIN/MAXers than anyone else.
