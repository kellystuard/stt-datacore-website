His employment file lists his given name; Ahmal M'jomo Jamaael, which means."He who is spirited." Oh hell yea, I did just drop a Sister Act 2 reference.

When there are thousands of crew notes to churn through, we’ve got to get economical, so allow me to rip from a Super Rare whom Amal profiles similarly to - Altan Soong. “His collection value will never escape the hundreds’ rank, his arena ability is superfluous, and his event clip will never be outstanding. [Chakotay] profiles as a fantastic early game pickup if you can snag multiple copies from an event, but don’t expect to fully fuse him from beholds before he would fall from daily use on your roster.”
