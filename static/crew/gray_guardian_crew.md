Pictured from the (thankfully) final appearance of this character in Discovery, Guardian Gray is a Collection and Trait-heavy Super Rare Crew that falls solidly into the category of “finish, freeze, and freakin’ forget” for most veteran Timelines enjoyers. Newer players will enjoy some use of Gray on Voyages until supplanted by the regular stream of Legendary Crew at high Fusion levels from Endurance Objective Events and Mega Events, but everyone will enjoy tickmarks on a solid sextet of Collections, with room for up to two more. Alliteration of the crew name aside, just remember to finish, freeze, and forget!
