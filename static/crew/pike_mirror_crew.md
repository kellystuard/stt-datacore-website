Shinier, musclier, and Jeffreyier than the 1991 Topps Mirror Kirk card, it’s no surprise that Mr. Hunter’s mustache twirling version is also far superior statistically. In fact, Mirror Universe cards have a reputation for being downright awful, whether because of age or lack of a third skill.

That’s not to say that this Pike is an ultra versatile all-star, but he shouldn’t have trouble contributing on any roster, starting with an above average voyage profile. CMD/SEC/ENG is a sneaky bloated skill set with fifteen top 100 options starting with the FBB darling Chances Taken Kirk, but Pike debuts as the top option in that skill set for four of his seven antimatter seats and should enjoy a multi-year run on the average roster.

More impressive yet is his event work. Would it surprise you to learn that Mirror Pike has received an event bonus a total of forty-one times since he took command of the Enterprise? I must say, Captain, it surprised the hell out of me. Our events tab documents the circumstances in each of those instances. Whether Pike himself is snagging character bonuses with his Strange, New resurgence in popularity or his half dozen viable traits kicking in, he’s averaged just under three events with a Faction component per year over the last five. That’s not bad for someone who technically died fifty-five years ago.
