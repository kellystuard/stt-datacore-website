Duty. A Big Book writer's life is filled with solemn duty. I have ranked crew into obscurity. I have negotiated articles between outrageous proficiencies. I have represented the Timelines Community in first contact with twenty-seven hundred different cards, but none of this compares to my solemn duty today...of writing this note.

Having debuted with ‘meh’ power (which has only gotten worse), you can only guess where Deanna ranks on the power totem pole now. Well, you don’t have to guess, actually, you can just check this page. 

She’s not helped out by any semblance of Proficiency power either, which her MED/CMD stack could really take advantage of in the Gauntlet. Outside of a pair of 45% Gauntlets for new players only, there’s no value to be had there. With a poor Collection profile and somewhat lagging behind in Event chances, Bridal Troi is more of a precision screwdriver whose post-Voyage prospects are iffy at best.

Now, I know that on an occasion such as this it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed crew. But have you lot considered what you are doing to me?
