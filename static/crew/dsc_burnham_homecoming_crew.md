If you're coming to this Burnham variant fresh or still mulling a last star, it's much easier to pass on her at this point than on day one. CMD/SEC doesn't need any Voyage help on most rosters and Courier's power there isn't close to the right part of the bell curve, so she's just another name at this point, even if she would make a run here and a run there depending on the depth of your roster.

The Event work still remains fine, but be wary of past Discovery Mega Events’ influence on what looks to be a rock solid Event history. While Burnham variants will never hurt for Event work, don’t expect double handfuls of Events annually.

A trio of Collections and another trio of viable Traits gives her a decent ceiling in that area, so while Courier was ok to finish if you were current with her Mega Event, the best course of action at this point would be to let Beholds build her slowly and use her partially Fused in Events where possible.
