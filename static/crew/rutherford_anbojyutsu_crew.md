Rutherford profiles as a fine Super Rare option for early game rosters. He offers enough power in three different areas to either be a cog on your roster or competent substitute while your partially fused Legendary crew are tied up elsewhere. 

His shipboard package is the most notable attribute here. A nice composite of high uptime, big instant damage, and lack of a firing limit give him viability in all ship modes early on. A top five debut SEC base should also see his number called frequently on daily shuttles or in the handful of Faction events per year heâ€™s likely to see.
