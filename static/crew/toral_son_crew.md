A fine event reward filler, Toral is hardly a memorable character (pipsqueak Toral from TNG sticks in the brain much easier), but there’s enough meat on the bone here to justify tapping for an hour or two on the weekend.

Toral’s traits afford him a surprisingly robust event profile and pairs well with a skill set pointed more toward shuttles than voyages. With multiple Faction events in every calendar year save the strike-shortened 2016, he’s likely worth 100 merits now and then, especially since all of his traits are likely to host events flush with SEC shuttle seats.

He’s also a perfunctory acquire-and-freeze for veteran players stacking collections. His biggest blemish, primarily because new players could have used the shipboard damage, is a boarding trigger which has never been fashionable in the game’s long history. I mean, I saw a lot of Prakesh in the arena circa 2018, but….no.
