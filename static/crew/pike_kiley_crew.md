A climactic moment of diplomacy in Strange New Worlds’ premiere not rewarded with the Diplomat trait during the Diplomat mega? And the beat goes on…

Pike might be more bark than bite, thanks to a lot of trait “noise”. With five of his traits very unlikely to provide collection or event value, his value in those areas are quite a bit weaker than a first glance would intimate. And his voyage skill set is racing CMD/DIP/SEC for the highest saturation in the game, despite its acceptable surface level power for a Super Rare.

His most notable attribute on release is a top X DIP pair, which is infamous for its world record in Fastest Race to Irrelevance. Pike certainly has some avenues for daily use, but comes out of the box with most of his value front-loaded and isn’t terribly attractive to Elder players.
