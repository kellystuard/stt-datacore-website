We here at the fatted calf that is the BigBook are a veritable fruit salad of insubordination. We’ve been cooking up some healthy strategies to marinate ourselves into the crew analysts the community knows we can be, but that’s been far from easy as pie. We need to find an outlet for all of our unsanctioned tools. Maybe we should make paella?

Well, eat your heart out dear reader, for here comes Lower Decks’ latest culinary classic: Migleemo. He may not be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but for a Super Rare serving does he at least cut the mustard? Let’s dig in.

As per usual, cards like these can bear fruit for younger rosters, bringing Voyage utility and relatively decent shuttle stats that new players can take advantage of before they start to acquire tastier Legendary options. We’d have egg on our face if we didn’t remind you that, at launch, you can earn him for peanuts thanks to his Event’s Community Rewards. Unfortunately, Migleemo’s goose is cooked beyond those attributes, as the bread and butter of just about anyone’s roster will soon leave him feeling like small potatoes, so if he’s ever in a Behold for you, you may want to think about how much you like his art before writing him off as a lemon.
