A Trait demigod, Self-Absorbed Dukat (like that narrows it down) is the Tom Brady or Wayne Gretzky of Collections; cut his Traits in half and he still has two Hall of Fame careers.

A day that sees him headlining ten or eleven Collections should surprise no one and really drives home all the Trait nitpicking we do on various shows and forums. At least, that’s what I tell myself.

Even if you’re a new player with an eye for daily help only, Dukat’s merely adequate Proficiencies see an absurd number of elevated Crit Gauntlets and he can be a pain for opposing players to try to roll against when he shows up at 65%. His Event history is curiously shallow considering the bevy of Traits, but that dam could break at any time and his Shuttle-friendly Bases would be fine for requisition work.
