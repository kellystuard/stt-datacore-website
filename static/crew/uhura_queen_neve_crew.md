If there's a air of whimsy and fairytale fancy in the air, then don't worry, it's not just the local Ren Faire alcohol fumes wafting your way - you're just picking up on the fact that WRG is feeling Elysian Kingdom fever, and the only cure, is more cowbell. Er, more Elysian crew. In fact, some data for you: in the beginning, the Elysian releases were spaced by twenty-four hours, then twelve, then six, then every two hours. The last event release was one hour ago. In four minutes, we could be seeing Elysian crew every eight minutes . . . until they are coming every four minutes . . .

Sorry, wait, that was Pacific Rim. ANYWAY. 

Queen Neve is almost exactly what every roster wants out of an event purple - good voyage power, even in a so-so skill set; strong bases that will see use in common Faction seats; unique traits, giving her almost Garak-esque collection potential; she even comes bundled with a relatively quick starting +9 Attack boost on ships. And if we do get the much ballyhooed Elysian collection, no matter the reward, she's an essential part of the fairytale, so grab her while you can, and marvel at the truly tier 1 art on display. Treat yourself, and pay special attention to the fabric detailing on her stocking, or the lighting on the left hand side of her gown - everywhere you look, she's just a sumptuously fun card that will pay dividends in the future.
