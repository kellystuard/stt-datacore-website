At last, cousin Ulis, wiser and more powerful than his pathetic relative Krem. Oh, what’s that? He’s just a Super Rare, while Krem is a Legendary? Even after all of his loving and generous treatment he reserved for his cowardly family member? Is this mistreatment for Ethan Phillips also playing Neelix? I bet Jeffrey Combs bribed someone over at WRG.

Perhaps Krem had a hand in developing Ulis’ stats as well, as nothing stands out as exceptional. With our Nightmare Mode™ blinders on we can see that he has a serviceable if unremarkable SEC base, which will tide newer players over until a proper Legendary option drops if they still find themselves lacking in that department. This brings with it some potential Voyage viability that again will only be temporary as one waits for better Behold options to make their appearance. What every player will enjoy, however, is his place in three Stat-Boosting Collections (including, of course, the massive ENT one) and the chance at perhaps three more. I wouldn’t go searching for Enterprise’s vault just to grab a copy, but I’m not going to crack my energy whip in anger if I do, either.
