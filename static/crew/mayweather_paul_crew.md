Well, we finally made it, folks. We finally hit the point where the other boring Mayweather has his own Super Rare representation in Star Trek: Timelines. Picard at El-Adrel? Stuff that down in Rares, we need to give THIS guy the full four star treatment. Befitting his appearance in maybe not the worst, but certainly the most boring kind of Trek, the dreaded Travis focus episode, Paul hits the game with a resounding thud that reassures you that he will never get any better - only worse. Tapped out on Collections almost immediately barring outside chance Courier and having an Event profile with all the forward-looking prospects of a silk stocking full of Denebian slime, he might run the occasional Voyage for you in the very early game thanks to a somewhat uncommon Skill stack and okay metrics. Just don't be surprised if, with Super Rare Power Creepâ„¢ proceeding apace, there are immediately better prospects already on the (ECS) Horizon.
