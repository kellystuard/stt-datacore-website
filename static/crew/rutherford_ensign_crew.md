Amazing! Rutherford would be as excited by his Uncommon variant as he is with a double latticed thermal mesh, and if you are a new player you should be too! He is among the top Voyagers in his Rarity and his ENG Base will help with some tricky early game Node clearing and Cadet Mission usage (though sadly his Trait set doesn't qualify him for any locked ones). For everyone else heâ€™s an easy Immortalization in 3 Stat-boosting Collections.
