A clear “use” option at the Super Rare level, Altan has held up better than one might have thought. His voyage ability still abides for his skill set and his base rank has endured admirably as well. But with the ease of Legendary crew acquisition in the era of megas and objective events, Altan’s attributes begin to wilt elsewhere.

His collection value will never escape the hundreds’ rank, his arena ability is superfluous, and sans a Spiner mega a la Spocktober, his event clip will never be outstanding. Soong profiles as a fantastic early game pickup if you can snag multiple copies from an event, but don’t expect to fully fuse him from beholds before he would fall from daily use on your roster.
