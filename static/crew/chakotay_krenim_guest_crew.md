Receiving very little Event love from WRG and lacking much of a Collection ceiling, there’s no cushiony fallback for this Chakotay, since he has stopped making Voyages for most and is best approached by players who have an affection for treasonous, out-of-touch, character-undermining episode arcs. If you’re one of those players, you’ll get some reward from his middling Collection profile; a ceiling of four.
