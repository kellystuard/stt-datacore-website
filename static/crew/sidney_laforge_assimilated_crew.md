Imagine hearing all your dad’s wacky stories from back in the day, and then getting to live them over with some of his old friends? Now, imagine getting to experience the nightmares too…

Speaking of nightmares…only Nightmare Mode™ players are likely to find much worth in Sid here, whose respectable-for-her-rarity Voyage numbers will see plenty of use, especially when paired with the right Antimatter seating bonuses. As always, this could be useful for new players too, however unless you find yourself able to earn multiple copies on debut, you’re going to have far better off quality of crew before you come across all her necessary copies naturally. What the rest of the Timelines community doesn’t get to fall back on is any semblance of Gauntlet, Captain’s Division Arena (there are heavier hitters already in the game), or Collection utility. Seriously, only one Collection on debut? What year is this? Freeze and forget after her introductory Event is over, or take her if you must in a future Behold.
