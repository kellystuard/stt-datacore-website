On your marks, get set, hold your horses? Harral has a pretty specific value which weâ€™ll touch on in a minute, but there are many more things that he is not. A reasonable voyage option in a vacuum, this green guy has the misfortune of releasing contemporarily with a 4/5 giveaway and two different event Legendaries all with the same skill set. As voyages are not a Super Rare attribute to chase via beholds, only rewarding one star at a time, this is merely on-paper value for most players.

A reasonable SCI base will also hurt for use chances due to an overreliance on Discovery megas which we swear are *probably* dead this time. But the thing to note with Harral is his place in your cryostasis vault. The upcoming Explorer collection (this is why you read Super Rare crew notes) will bring him to four collections a month after his release and as an easy immortalization to stave off having to cite one of those Legendary Orion slave girls, he will indirectly save you some honor hassle there.
