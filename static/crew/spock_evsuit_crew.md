Weâ€™re going to let you in on a little secret that Big Sanitation doesnâ€™t want you to know - you can actually take the porta potty with you. Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s named after: portable potty. The more you know.

Thatâ€™s not to suggest that Spockâ€™s suit is full of ðŸ’©, in fact heâ€™s held up alright for a crew with a statistically under the radar release. His Traits (including the hidden â€˜evsuitâ€™) give him big boy Collection potential and will certainly make him a future Crew Retrieval option for any players who were absent for his introductory Mega Event

If youâ€™re looking for even more long term value, check out his burly Event history thatâ€™s as reliable as almost any crewâ€™s in the game. Quibbles over raw Base rank or competition among variants donâ€™t carry as much weight when dealing with a crew who shows up with a bonus every other month; he should never be hurting for opportunity.

With some new player Proficiencies to help you crack into the competitive area of Gauntlet, EV Spock hits the mark from a bunch of different angles and should have enough fuel in his jet pack to power up your roster for years to come.
