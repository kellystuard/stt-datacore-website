It rubs the Iotion on the skin or gets the heater, see. Jokes aside, those little TP errors just add a Human Touch. 

The Boss, Bela Oxmyx has joined his partner in crime JoJo Krako Out In The Street and he can be yours in the time portal right now if you’re willing to Pay Me My Money Down. Now if you were Born In The U.S.A., it’s easy to have an affinity for a Real Man like Bela, but some of us just want the skinny on his stats. Will he lead your roster to The Promised Land?

Surface level base and voyage metrics look good enough to Breakaway from a redundant skill set and even as he’ll Fade Away from daily use, there’s value elsewhere. In the arena, Bela is The Hitter, boasting a strong instant damage ability which utilizes position instead of cloak so that you’re not Dancin’ In The Dark. As a late game veteran, Super Rares usually offer me Nothing Man, but Surprise, Surprise, this is My Lucky Day, with Bela boasting strong collection numbers and room to grow.
