“Eyes in the dark. One moon. Eyes in the dark. One moon circles. See the eyes in the dark. One moon.”

Two eyes and one moon sounds like the start of a three-body problem. Unfortunately, until such time as this BB writer can find a closed-form solution to this classic dynamic motion puzzle and earns the Nobel Prize in Physics, we’re going to have to focus our efforts on extolling Troi’s virtues in Star Trek Timelines. Good thing she has plenty to offer!

Let’s start with the thing that stands out immediately: that art. It feels like you’re right there in the episode, experiencing the same terrible dreams. Top notch effort by the Timelines artist on this assignment.


If you can take your eyes (in the dark) away from her glowiness, you’ll find Troi’s stats to be equally deserving of attention. Coming at you hard and fast is a hearty DIP Base that anchors a top notch Triplet/Skill Pairing Voyage score! Move over Tribble Quark, it’s Troi’s time to shine! With a trait set and MED tertiary that will help earn plenty of extra seats, Night Moves Troi will punch above her weight for ages to come.

Perhaps a bit locked out on potential future Collections, she only has two for now (but at least they are Stat-Boosters). Meanwhile, her Ship Ability may seem decent at first glance with its decent Crit boost and speedy Initialisation time, however that god-awful cool down time removes essentially all usefulness. So, let’s just ignore this and look back at the art shall we?

PS: Just had a crazy dream and turns out all this is is a metaphor for Hydrogen?! How’s that gonna win a Nobel Prize?
