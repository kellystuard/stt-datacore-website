Is Jenna looking back over her shoulder at all the Super Rares that are objectively worse than she is? Maybe, but there are quite a few better as well. Jenna Mitchell-watch-watch-watch (no relation to Gary so far in canon), is a bit of a one-trick pony, with a 250% Instant Damage Ship Ability with a 10s Initialization, Accuracy Boost, and no Limit or Triggers. Sure, there are better but there are also a lot worse. So for the new player, Jenna will get lots of use in your Skirmishes and Arena Battles, and consider her passable Voyage power, single Collection, and non-CDS Skill set all bonuses for the early game.
