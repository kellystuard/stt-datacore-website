Whoa, that art. Red Angel redux may not smack you between the eyes like the original, but Edward Scissorwings here is still a gorgeous offering for those who look up from their spreadsheets from time to time. Alternatively: Burnham’s mom has got it goin’ on.

A Voyage powerhouse on debut and for the first 12-18 months of her tenure, more recent crew have begun to clip her wings there. Still on the edge of Voyage viability, her use in that game mode will depend on the rest of your roster.

As she gracefully ages out of daily use, we are left looking at her Trait list to provide enduring value, and it’s a good one! A legitimate shot at six or seven Collections puts her well-above average in that regard, and the Events that go with all those ancillary Traits give her life in the weekends.
