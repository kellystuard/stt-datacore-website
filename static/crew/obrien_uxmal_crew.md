Fun fact: the working title of this episode was “Worf Runs Afoul of an Irishman”. Colm Meaney actually spent a week locked in a hotel room with nothing but room service and a Blue Barrel in order to prepare for that scene. Absolute robbery he didn’t come away with an Emmy for that dedication.

Evil O’Brien actually is good at fighting in Timelines as well! Some very meaty proficiency scores will draw your eyes right away, and if you know your existing Gauntlet sets you should be quick to notice that he gets plenty of high Crit Bonus opportunities. Unfortunately, you’ll then spot that his Skillset is already populated with even better Gauntlet exclusives (or the made-for-Gauntlet Voyage exclusive that is Admiral Black) that at this point most players should have at least one copy of. Don’t shy away from grabbing him should you have the opportunity (remember, you only need one for Gauntlet crew to get used!), but just know that he’s going to be more of a variety piece/change of pace in your loadout rather than the “everyone used the same crew” wall breaker we all hope for these days.
