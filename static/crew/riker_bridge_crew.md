Between the skill set and grungy attire, it’s like Auggie Rike is all grown up, though the Super Rare version is arguably more intriguing.

Riker’s value rests on the twin pillars of a reasonable voyage debut and dependable event history. But while those are worthwhile attributes which have carried myriad crew to relevance, Bridge is hunting for supplementary value. His variants are numerous, cutting into any singular event value, his skill set is plentiful on voyages, and his scorecard reveals numerous holes in other areas.

His awesome art, like the season of Trek he comes from, is a nice nostalgia hit, but this is clearly a “smoke ‘em if you got ‘em” scenario depicting a crew whose value will not endure for long outside of Faction Action weekends.
