If you were in the Big Book lounge during this crew's release, you may have heard muttered a few, "Hell if I know"s, and boy were they earned. Bones only has one Skill, but it's bloody enormous. He's dominated the MED metrics with ease aside from some pesky Culber interference and should retain value in the realm of Shuttles much longer than, say, a Voyage-centric option would.

He's going to be used, the only question is how often? With the MED Skill bringing up the rear accounting for only 7-8% of Event seating, there are weekends where you won't see a single MED seat across any of the 3-Seat missions and only sprinkled in sparingly elsewhere. Yet with only a handful of Super Rares able to match him with a bonus, Bones often only needs one opportunity to be the best choice.

The value of a naked Shuttle score is among the most variable attributes to try and rank. If you run Tanked Shuttlesâ„¢ or max difficulty missions, if you love Faction Events or eschew them in favor of other types... Bones is far from Captain Scott territory, but you should try him out for yourself to see how often he's making a difference for you and to what degree.
