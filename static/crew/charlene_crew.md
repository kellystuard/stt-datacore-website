A holographic Stepford Wife for the EMH’s “Kenneth”, Charlene is not without her charms. Perhaps Kenny designed her to be a good Super Rare; she has strong Voyager power on debut to go with a bulky DIP Base for when her Traits give her a weekend bonus. Traits should top her off an above average four Collections, and if you’re in need of some help on your Ships, Charlene brings a chunk of 12000 Crit Bonus aboard, albeit slowly Activating and Cycling. Let’s hope we get Stressed-Out Charlene after Torres modifies the EMH’s holoprogram for a little more fun later.
