Usually a little bit of MED goes a long way, but when it’s in a Skill triplet with DIP and SCI, its usual dance partners, and it isn’t the Primary Skill, it doesn’t go far enough.

Blue uniform Christine Chapel does enjoy the sparsely-populated Nurse Voyage Antimatter Trait, making her the strongest Voyager with that Trait not named the elusive One Way Ticket variant of the same character. Just a pair of Collections on debut to go with two more edge-case viable Traits give her a below average rating in that arena, and without any Gauntlet or Ship Ability utility to buoy her Tier rank, she’s left with just her aggressive average Voyage power and fan-favorite source episode to make you want her.
