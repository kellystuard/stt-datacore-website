Seamus only asks for a shilling or two, but you're better off tossing a coin to your Witcher. The Story of Seamus begins and ends with his Traits. He offers some value in both Collections and Events, though nothing is guaranteed from this card and it may take a while and more than a few pints before he becomes attractive to endgame players.
