The latest Endurance Objective Event Giveaway/Reward, this version of N’Odo shares an Enterprise episode with fellow Legendary crew Liana and will soon flummox Fleet Boss Battle Node solvers with Kantare-required solutions. Of course, if you don’t solve Nodes, you don’t care. Maybe you’re just excited to get more René Auberjonois in the game (I know that I am!) or to get a “free” Legendary at 80% of Immortalization. 

For the new or mid-game player, Ezral is probably a no-brainer Immortalization for that fifth star to realize his viable-enough Voyage power, big ENG Base for Continuum Missions (sorry, no unique Quipment though), and a big enough Instant Damage Ship Ability coming online at 6s for your Arena and Skirmlish loadouts. A quartet of Collections does make Ezral an enticing Citation target even for the Elderly Player™, so you may want to see if finishing him might get you close to the next milestone and delicious global Stat Boost.
