Respectfully, what a tremendous dick. Played by Robert Foxworth, who you may remember as another tremendous dick (Admiral Layton) in Deep Space Nine, V’las was instantly and exceedingly hateable as Enterprise's season four foil. This statistical incarnation is regrettably less memorable. 

Mid-level by most metrics, V’las can at least boast a top ten SCI base on debut which, in combination with his cheap Vulcan quipment, gives him a leg up in Continuum Missions. His lack of punch on voyages is more unfortunate considering he’s found a nice skill order niche, sharing it with only two other gold crew, one of whom is our most beloved, but no longer usable General Trelane, Retired.

His traits work in concert with that plus skill order to give him limited time usability on voyages, but more interestingly grant him a nice pie-in-the-sky collection ceiling. A limitless shipboard damage ability rounds him out, but being concealed behind a cloak trigger means that he’ll almost certainly fail to be a “meta” choice on ships.
