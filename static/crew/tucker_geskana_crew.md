Shirtless art to pair with Scott Frontula's portrayal of Humbled Archer is worth a few Tiers in somebody's book, but it won't gain him any clout around here. Probably.

For Alien Lacrosse Trip, his value comes from a Shipboard Attack Boost best utilized by new players and a strong Shuttle Skill set. Tucker has parlayed a sparse Trait set into a quartet of Collections, which means heâ€™s a fine Super Rare Behold option for any player.
