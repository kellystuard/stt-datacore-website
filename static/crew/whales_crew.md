A fresh coat of hidden trait paint has renewed G&G’s time in the cadet spotlight. Now qualifying for all weekend cadet missions, that benefit stacks up alongside reasonable daily power and an adequate non-HFS trait list which should see an increase in collection value over time. We’re happy to sign off on them as one of your early Rare crew leveling projects. The hell they are our whales! 🐋 🐳
