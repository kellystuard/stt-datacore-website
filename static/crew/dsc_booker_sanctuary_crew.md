“Aggressively Average” is a phrase we’ve used several times before to describe certain cards and Booker is certainly the boilerplate example of this quote. Had this card been released a year ago then I might just have been uttering the words “Yes he’s CDS but…”. However, the Great Convergence has bestowed upon us a plethora of WRG’s default Skill set and we have to face the reality that Booker’s strong debut Voyage score will face redundancy, and quickly.

Okay look, if you’ve been living in a cave, taken a break, or are new then yes, Booker is an excellent card on paper. Still barely viable Voyage power combined with some useful seatable Traits and a decent chance of Event use moving forward is a fantastic reason for anyone to grab a copy. 450% Instant Damage, behind a Cloak Trigger, even at 10 seconds Activation, is a reasonable consideration for the Arena-philes who want a bit of extra damage.

But we have the CDS problem yet again. Mega Event Recurring crew are rife with it, Giveaway/Endurance Event crew have it. It’s the saturated fats of Timelines, not enough to make you ill but if you have too much you start to feel bloated and desperate to reach the nearest antacid.

A quartet of Collections plus anywhere from zero to four more (depending on how much of a reeeeeeeaaaach upcoming new Collections are) does give Cleveland some enduring value, so there’s no shame in picking him up from a Legendary Behold these days.
