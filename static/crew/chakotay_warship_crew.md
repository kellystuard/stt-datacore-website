An almost purely Trait-driven card at this point, Warship has the potential to climb the ranks despite his long time status as dud. Flaccid Bases meet the right Shuttle Skills and a modest Event clip to help him achieve spot-filler status, but streaky Mega Event-driven years of relevance aren't out of reach either.

Owning a lone Collection spot as of this write-up, that number is sure to grow over time. A heavily 
speculative option, don't feel obligated to feed him a Crew Slot if you're tight on space until his real world value has grown to reach his potential.
