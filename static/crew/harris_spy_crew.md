Super Rares with a handful of Event features are usually worth snagging at some point, even if they were featured alongside the likes of Anij and the Grand Nagus. But without any real daily use value, the only consistency you'll get from Harris is his spot in his two current Collections. One or two Traits may pop up for future Events or future Collections, so feel free to finish him when itâ€™s convenient.
