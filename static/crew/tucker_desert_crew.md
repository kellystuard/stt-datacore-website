Boasting a long-coveted skill set, Tucker joins the ranks of others who share it as a card to outperform his raw power level, but debuting with disappointing numbers shortens his shelf life there significantly. Events are likely to be his bread and butter where despite a primary base debut outside the top ten, he’s had plenty of bonuses over the years, particularly for an Enterprise series crew. His shipboard ability is also useful at a glance, but with TP printing hull repair options like candy, Trip’s slower cycle there may make him a less attractive option.

All the elements of a great crew are present, but TP turned the power knob down a bit too far for Tucker to be a strong recommendation as a card whose usage will endure.
