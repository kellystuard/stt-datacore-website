So young, so naive…Peanut Hamper thought she could make it as a Dabo Girl in the big city. Apparently waitress jobs were in short supply as well, so she settled for Starfleet Medical. Anything to piss off your parents, amirite?!

Given her Starfleet role, Ensign Peanut Hamper is of course an ENG primary crew. Well…ok, she’s really good at surgery and stuff. That’s basically precision engineering with extra steps. And not to worry, the MED you assume she would have follows behind as her secondary skill. This combination helps make this plucky Exocomp a pretty solid Voyager, for a Super Rare. Nightmare Mode™ and newer players alike are advised to keep an eye on how she can improve your Voyages at this stage of your Timelines adventure, and everyone else may want to check on their Fleet Boss Battle lineup for the Hard difficulty, as as long as you aren’t going up against a Pakled Clumpship, she can give crew like Young T’Pau and Assistant Kes a run for their money as far as Attack Boost crew go. For everyone else, a debut five Stat-Boosting Collections, including a few big ones in which every non-Legendary crew counts, is enough to justify completing this little deserter.
