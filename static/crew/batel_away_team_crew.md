Normally, I would opine on not liking the thought of Captain Batel getting two spaghetti dinners. I mean, surely as Captain Pike is learning to cook for his crew and friends, he could do better than the same meal twice in a row, right? Well, better than reheated leftovers, Captain Batel has gotten her first Legendary representation in the game!...via a dreaded Tuesday Pack…it’s like leftovers that weren’t properly reheated.

Bringing a great debut Voyage score and raw power to the table, Away Team Batel shares the same triplet order as the aging Scapegoat O’Brien and Kashyk, who even after a year, still holds the edge here in raw Voyage power. Beyond the Eight Trait matches you could encounter, the good Captain will no doubt see some bonus work in future Strange New Worlds Events, and her massive Accuracy boost with a huge Crit Bonus may play into some niche Arena setups. I’d also like to point out that the art is really nicely done, worthy of being in a frame and put on Captain Pike’s desk.

If you’re not buying today, it’ll be a year or so before she’s available – and by that point, I’d be double checking the expiration date on the side of the package.
