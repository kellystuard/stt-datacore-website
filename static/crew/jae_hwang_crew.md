Jae Hwang, or "who?" to pretty much anyone that hasn't read his flavour text (even if they *did* watch ST: Picard), briefly reunited with his ex-wife while she was tracking down one of his contacts, Sneed‘s Feed and Seed (Formerly Chuck’s). Jokes aside though, his was a compelling if short-lived character appearance.

In-game, on the other hand, he’s a bit less noteworthy. There’s some Voyage and even Shuttle value there as a Fully Fused Super Rare if you’re a new player (or Nightmare Mode™ aficionado), but he’ll be quickly overshadowed as your roster plods along towards the Elderly era. What everyone can benefit from, however, is his place in three Stat-Boosting Collections, and potential for up to three more, making him a worthwhile investment regardless of where you are on your Timelines journey.
