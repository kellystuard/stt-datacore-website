It’s taken forever, but we’ve finally gotten Steven Culp’s Major Hayes into the game! The only thing more mysterious than why it took so long as what the J. stands for. Well, while you ruminate on that, let’s discuss the details of the card itself. 

A Tuesday Pack release (don’t pull Tuesday Packs, kids), Hayes is not a strong Voyager on release, doesn’t have a plus Skill set or Order, isn’t overly Traity for Collections and Events, and can’t smash fools in the Gauntlet. But, he’s got a solid dollop of Crit Bonus on Ships if SOMEHOW you don’t have anyone else for that role. Not a whole lot here, unfortunately.

Hey, we’re just happy that Major Josephine Hayes made the game. Hmm, maybe that’s why he just went by J. Hayes?
