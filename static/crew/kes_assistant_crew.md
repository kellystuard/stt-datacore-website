A new Kes card? What year is it, 2019?

If your Tuesday pack itch hasn’t been clawed off and sent to a local medical facility with recent offerings, a nice “normal” return to ‘Terrible Tuesday Traps’ is upon us – and the reward for your 650 Dilithium gamble?

Kes! Well, a Super-Rare Kes...but she’s still useful! And with great artwork!

Well, useful to Nightmare Mode™ enjoyers and those who only use Kes cards in their daily play, that is. She’s one of the best Super-Rare Voyaging cards in the game, with six trait matches and a high DIP base for shuttles. She also rounds out three Collections at launch with a fourth, Telepath, surely to come eventually.  

Don’t go diving into packs to get her today, but in a year from now, you can get her via Retrieval, Packs, or a disappointing non-Legendary Voyage drop and celebrate that that’s one less ‘Portal Purple’ you need.
