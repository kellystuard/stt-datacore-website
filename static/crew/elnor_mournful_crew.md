From that godawful “Star Trek in Elvish” wink/nod name to a second 2-Skiller variant who looks like he belongs on page 27 of a men’s fashion magazine, Elnor is not exactly burning things up in our little corner of Trekdom.

The B I G B A S E crowd will be happy to see another DIP option for the *checks notes* 2018 Romulan Mega Event, but jokes aside, how Elnor’s Traits break in the future are going to determine whether this card sinks or swims. Obviously viable Bases have had scant opportunities to shine based on his past bonus tally, but at least most of his Traits have a puncher’s chance to be featured (again) moving forward.

They also comprise what could end up as the bulk of his value over time; Collections. Elnor has a decent Collection ceiling of somewhere between four and five total, so he’d be a worthwhile investment to slowly Fuse and then stick in Cryostasis.
