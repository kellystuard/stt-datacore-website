There's two ways WRG usually prints helmsman cards - either you're a Sulu, and you get maybe two good variants out of ten, or you're a Paris, and you're blessed with a hundred cosplay episodes that guarantee a medley of Skill sets and cards for years to come. Ortegas' first bit of rep in the game skews closer to the former, just barely keeping her head above water thanks to the +1 Resourceful (the go-to when they realize they're about to ask you to Cite or buy a crew without a Collection) and the uncommon Maverick and Pilot Traits, which may yet materialize into something useful. Otherwise, she slides right into the butt groove left behind by so many other dreary CDS cards, all of which are broadly interchangeable, and fans of Melissa Navia's Twitter are left to hope that this is just 'Promo Card Syndrome' rather than a statement of intent.
