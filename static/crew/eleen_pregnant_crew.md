The recipient of a gif-famous McCoy slap, Eleen is a Super Rare Tuesday Pack crew, which really says it all for what we think of Pack diving (don’t!). However, once she does enter the Time Portal, she does with a lot of benefits for the elderly player™: four Collections, including a slot in the tough Royalty set, and an interesting Ship Ability for Captain Division Arena enjoyers or those farming Honor from Fleet Boss Battles, Hard Difficulty. Speaking of FBB, as the second Capellan to enter the game, soon she and Maab will be the only solutions for certain Nodes once she enters the Time Portal.
