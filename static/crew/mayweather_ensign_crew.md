Similar to Ensign Chekov in that he has a high CMD stat for a Common Crew,, but completely redundant when compared to other cards that have better CMD, Traits and useful Ship abilities. Much like his character on the show, completely forgettable. Freeze and forget him, then have a small endorphin rush when the Pilot Collection debuts one day.
