After a brief cup of coffee in the Double Stuft tier 1, Pike landed gently in the awesome-but-not-jaw-dropping section, which is fair. He has tremendous base and voyage power, as well as his particular skill order all to himself for voyages, but ultimately lacks utility, as evidenced by his song being the shortest in the episode (sorry, Mr. Mount).

TP did fluff up his traits a hair, but even so this is a crew you want to throw that last campaign cite on immediately and ride his usage for a couple years rather than wait and see, even if heâ€™s not the most unique offering out there.
