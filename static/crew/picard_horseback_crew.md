A mega recurring Picard with an ENG primary and a *horse*. Instant cite, right? Well, maybe, but not for anything beyond what that headline implies - you’re paying for what’s on the tin.

The fourth ENG primary recurring or giveaway card over the last year, Picard is welcome but not necessarily an oasis in the desert. Once a rarely seen primary skill, along with MED, TP has been more cognizant of late that they have to spread the love around and get a little creative with their skill sets, which this card certainly is.

As part of the CMD/DIP/Whatever deluge over the last few years, Picard’s skill set has also flooded the market in a major way. Although his primary skill gives him a leg up (heehaw) in that regard, all the different permutations available still somewhat dampen this author’s enthusiasm for what would have once been a mouthwatering giveaway. 

Event weekends are where you're likely to see the longest return on your investment between the evergreen Picard brand name and a handful of viable traits. While he lacks in other areas and won’t shake up the meta like some previous mega cards (Garth in Arena, MJLP in Gauntlet), he’s sufficient in areas that are pillars of importance for players new to the game.
