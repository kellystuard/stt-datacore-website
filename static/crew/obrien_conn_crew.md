Look at that smile. So innocent, so pure. So ignorant of the existential horrors that will soon befall him when he trades his comfy conn position for Chief of Operations on a certain Cardassian space station. If I were a crueler individual and his Stats were a little worse, I'd almost recommend airlocking him just to save him the pain of seventeen rotator cuff injuries, multiple deaths, and having to deal with Dr. Bashir, the Alpha Quadrant's Biggest Nitwit. As it is, this is a crew you're going to want to Fuse and Freeze for those Collections notches, then thaw for the biannual O'Brien Events he's managed to average for the last eight years - nothing to burn the midnight petroleum over, but a worthwhile investment nonetheless.
