Khan Noonien Singh, facing off with Chekov (“I never forget a face!”), finally gives this epic character a second Legendary variant with far more utility than his game-launch brother “Wrathful Khan”.

For years players have longed for a crew like this, and here he stands! Highlights include “Later Losers++” power on Voyages, a BIG BASE™ to rule all Big Bases, and Traits and Collections for days and weeks and months!

When the gamemakers want to toss out a CMD/DIP/SEC crew lately, they like to give them uber power, since the stalwart hosts of Timelines Talks™ (The #1 Exclusive Show For All Things Star Trek Timelines) have consistently eviscerated them for stuffing crew after crew into that triplet for years and years. Lately, this triplet has only been filled out by exclusive crew like Tekeny Ghemor (ÜberKampaign) and Vori Defender Chakotay (Voyage Exclusive), so it’s quite a treat to see Khan available in an event.

Once you get your copy (or copies) of Khan from his debut event or event packs, and once you immortalize him right away (why wouldn’t you?!), he should Voyage for years on the back of his epic raw power and 5 Antimatter seats.

His other immediate value is in his 4 debut Collections, and he is Trait-rich so you can safely invest and watch him gain 2-3 more in the coming years, and by then he’ll probably still be Voyaging! 

<Obligatory mention of his gigantic DIP base for Shuttles here.>
