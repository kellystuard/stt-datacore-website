It’s not a stretch to say that C.O.P Janeway is the best mega recurring Legendary in an off-cycle mega in the history of Star Trek Timelines!  That joke now out of the way, it’s hard to argue ENT-era blue jumpsuit Kathryn is without her gameplay utility charm.

On the heels of an identical triplet and the same top-two skill Federation President Archer released just a week before, she’ll warp particles(!) her way onto many of your voyages in the upcoming years with SEVEN (count ‘em again, SEVEN) antimatter traits in one of the various jumpsuit pockets she has available.  She finds herself among the top options for all of these seats so she will get you +25 AM on a voyage early, and often!

A lack of anything noteworthy in terms of Gauntlet and Ship Battle abilities does not dampen her other pluses, which include FOUR collections at launch (one vanity), and one more viable Tactician that is in WRG’s sweet spot for future inclusion in a stat-boosting collection.

Everybody knows Janeway events can be counted on, and she’s got a huge CMD base to help out in those.  She may even find herself Shuttlepodding her way onto non-bonus event shuttles when your Faction strategy requires lots of requisition launches.

In the words of Kathryn Janeway from the Voyager episode “Good Shepherd”:

“Not bad.”
