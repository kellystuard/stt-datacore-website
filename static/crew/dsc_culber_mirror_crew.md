Stylish red Terran Empire Starfleet uniform aside, Hugh has unfortunately aged far out of daily use despite an attractive Skill set and order on Voyages. Not all is bad news; Culber has a solid one-two punch left in reserve in Trait and variant-based Event chances, as well as bites at the Collection apple.

The 2022 resurrection of Discovery Mega Events notwithstanding, Culber has the big SEC base to jump aboard your Shuttles whenever his name is called, even though his variant Event chances have literally nowhere to go but up. Four Collections as it stands, plus another viable Trait or two, makes him an above average choice in that regard, and a strong mid-level Behold choice, or Crew Retrieval candidate.
