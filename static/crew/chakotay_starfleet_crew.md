The gut reaction with Chakotay is (usually) just no. Redundant skill set, no special attributes, no nonhuman or female tags for extra cadet eligibility. He’s not even wearing a belt for Pete’s sake.

But if you can stomach his irritating build cost (why does CMD/DIP/SUCK need so many MEDICAL experiments?), he’ll still perform fine for cadet mission three days per week with a primary and secondary combined stat just high enough to show up clutch and a smattering of galaxy map node unlocks. That’s about as strongly as we can endorse him, at least until more of his traits hit on collections, but it’s also completely valid to continually airlock him until you have spare materials and trainers to mop up the rest of your missing Uncommon crew and Chuckles along with them.
