An updated version of older brother Prospero, Hay Bale Data excels in similar areas. With strong collection and event work, he will appeal more to veterans than new players, but everybody can benefit. Take note of his expensive build cost including a fistful of Sec 31 items, but he pays off the investment when finished.
