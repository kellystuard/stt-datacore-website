Another member of the “Wyatts Three”, if you pull the string on his back, he’ll tell you to “Reach for the skyyyy”. It’s too bad Wyatt Earp the card doesn’t quite reach to infinity and beyond. 

Little else but a small but hardy set of Traits, Earp enjoys a Vanity entry and a ceiling of four Stat-boosting Collections, and the Events that may go along with. CMD/DIP/SEC stinks everywhere but Faction Event seating, so enjoy it here.
