You don’t mess with the Zho’Kaan! Terrible Adam Sandler move aside, this kneeling Arkonian will not likely be owned by many players until the Time Portal Update sometime in 2024 or 2025, so focusing on his long-term value here. 

His six pack of (visible) Traits give him a chance for a six pack of Collections if they all hit paydirt, the hidden “ent” tag giving him one of his two current ones. What more could you ask for from a Super Rare Crew? Well, there’s a little extra gas in the tank here with an interesting Ship Ability - +12000 to Crit Bonus with an Accuracy Boost at 6s. Yes, it’s Ardra-lite but nothing to sneeze at, especially for the best Arkonian in the game.
