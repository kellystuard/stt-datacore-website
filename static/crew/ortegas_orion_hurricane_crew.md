It’s always nice to see a new crew released with an eclectic Trait like Bartender, and that may be about where the interesting aspects of Orion Hurricane Ortegas end. Seemingly all the Ortegas variants have been released at “aggressive average” power level or worse and sink fast, and this crew is not a departure from this. Serviceable power on Voyages is helped along by a Skill set that thankfully is not a permutation of CMD/DIP/SCI; Ortegas gets SEC instead! Below average for Event chances and about average for Collection inclusions, Erica also gets an unusual Position Trigger-locked Accuracy boost to an unnecessary +15. So… she flies the ship?
