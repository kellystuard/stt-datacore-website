Everyone knows how much Worf loves being Klingon. How much stock he puts in honour, while pairing that nicely with the ideals of Starfleet. So anyway, here’s the guy who convinced him dabble in a little bit of terrorism and *sabotage Risa’s weather control system* with some pretty words and a pamphlet..

Pascal Fullerton may have been a brief appearance in terms of the Star Trek Universe, but thanks to that masterful conversion of Worf to his movement, he comes to us here in Timelines with a BigBase™ in DIP…no, CMD? Oh, SCI, huh. Never mind that, he’s strong and that means potentional use whenever Crafty or Federation gets its turn (let’s not kid ourselves, he’ll never get another variant).

This large SCI is backed up by a not too shabby DIP and a SEC kicker that helps contribute to some potential Voyage use, tempered by the fact that this is a busy Pairing. His spread of traits will certainly find him a home though, and if you’re earning four of his five copies thanks to participation in his Mega you can maybe spare a cite to pad out the corners of your Voyage roster. Unfortunately, he doesn’t offer much else in terms of gameplay (these traits only give a single Collection), so anyone finding Pascal in a BeGold can happily move on to one of the other options.
