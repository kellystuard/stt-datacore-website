Starfleet really needs to send out a Directive, or at least a memo. Stop touching masks. Do you know how hard the Interior Design team worked on those starship aesthetics?
Thanks to the addition of the Compromised trait and Collection (“The Shadow Within”), a flood of crew with this trait are being added to the game in short order. They’re even building a Mega Event around it! That’s going to provide increased value on release for this Freeman variant who, if you’re contemplating her in a future BeGold once she hits Portal, doesn’t have much else worth exalting upon.

Respectable, if nothing special, Voyage use can be found with this SCI Primary crew who has the power to take a seat when the Antimatter bonus trait is right, as she tops the charts in raw power there for a number of them. That of course requires all five stars, and your cites are certainly better spent elsewhere. The “get’em while they’re hot” appeal of Carol, however, is going to be Faction Event use on SCI seats whenever Compromised (or Spiritual) is the featured trait. With her 400% Instant Damage overshadowed by so many other crew in the game at this point, most players will end up freezing her by the time she’s Immortalised, only breaking her out for the odd Event or maybe a themed bridge.
