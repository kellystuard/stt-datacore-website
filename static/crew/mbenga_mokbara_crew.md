What cuisines are being fused? Polynesian and Scandinavian. It's called Mahalo Valhalla.

An M’Benga with tunic asunder, boasting SEC/MED? Surely I’ve been a good boy and this is the rapture? Not exactly. TP had the chance to do the greatest thing ever and then someone in their Slack chat said, “Eh, they’ll pay for this crap anyways so the stats don’t matter.” Well, here at the Big Book, it’s still real to us, dammit.

It’s called “requisite” power for a reason, because it’s required and Mok’Benga just doesn’t have it. On shuttles and voyages, he’s just a barely there option when traits or skills align and that’s the kind of usage you want to see from your four year old cards, not the four week old ones. A reasonable shipboard damage ability can’t decide if it wants to be Arena utility based on its fire limit of two or a Fleet Boss Battle option based on its slow initialization. Either way, better options than M’Benga abound in every area of the game for this unfortunately under-statted card.
