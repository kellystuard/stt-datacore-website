This bland, Super Rare version of Pelia doesn’t have a lot to distinguish her from other ENG-Primary Super Rares, unless you could her unique racial Trait and conspicuously-absent spot in the Jury Rigger Collection. With only a single Collection on debut, the “let’s slap it on this crew cause we want to not make them a complete potato” Resourceful Trait, at least everyone’s favorite Lanthanite has two or three more Traits stored in her belt pouch for later.
