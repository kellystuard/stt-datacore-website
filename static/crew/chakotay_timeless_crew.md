Rura Penthe not having any banks to rob, it’s a truly head-scratching decision to go with the worst possible reference and then interpretation of art for Silver Fox Chakotay. Literally five seconds of googling “Timeless Chakotay” provides one with a dozen better choices. But for those of you who play the game via spreadsheets and Unsanctioned third party tools, I digress.

The Michelin Man is actually one of the best statistical additions to the Dishonor Hall in years. The debatable value of certain Fleet Boss Battle options aside, Baked Potato Chakotay shows up big in the universally useful area of voyages. He’s the best Honor Hall option in that realm since Kahless’ #1 overall debut back in 2017, due in most part to a unique skill order among legendary crew and substantial Antimatter hit rate. 

If the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man had come out any earlier than he had, we’d probably knock him for being fairly one-note. Despite a top ten CMD base on release, Chakotay is a largely forgotten name for events. Enter Continuum Missions, where his strong combined CMD score and elite voyage pairing makes him a worthy candidate for quipment to help bolster your roster in both areas.

A viable, if niche option to slot into a Negh’var lineup in the Admiral division of arena, Chakotay’s value there is more of a supplement than needle-mover. Between his unique voyage skill set and dubious value in certain attributes, this is a difficult crew to forecast a future for, but is certainly a useful option on release.
