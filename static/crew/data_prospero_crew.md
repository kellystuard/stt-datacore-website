We previously said Prospero, a 2017 crew, was starting to look his age, but we lied to you. Having missed out on the Holodeck Enthusiasts collection to his big brother Data V, Prospero still retains solid collection value and also offers great weekend shuttle work thanks to event-friendly traits and Data’s ubiquity. The catch is that it's almost all post-cryo value for Prospero, ‘cause it's a Legendary's world and we're just livin' in it.
