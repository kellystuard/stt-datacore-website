Ezri is a textbook new player stepping stone crew. The young roster highlights, triggerless Arena damage and medium proficiencies with a handful of 45% Gauntlets, are available at one star making her an easy behold choice if you're just starting out. Unfortunately the other three stars don't measure up in value. Dax does boast plenty of Events and many rosters are looking to cobble Yoyage MED together from any source, but with 2016 stats, the window for use in those areas is short-lived.  

Ezri’s true value for the mid to late game player is in her quartet of Collections, including Badda-Bing Badda-Bang for snagging Scapegoat O’Brien.  The Goat is no longer “the GOAT” unfortunately as he’s aged, so it’s more a “vanity” play now to obtain him, but if you want him, you need Ezri.  Also look for Ezri to possibly add up to two more Collections via other viable Traits.

Considering the overall package and obligatory immotalization for the expansive Costume Party collection, Ezri exceeds the sum of her parts and is just waiting for that Bada Bang vanity collection to be fully joined.
