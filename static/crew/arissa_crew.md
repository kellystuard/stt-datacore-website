Characters in Timelines family scoreboard: Dey Young - 2, Leigh Taylor-Young - 0. Do we get Hannah Bates before Yanas Tigan?

The best Idanian in game (sorry Jenos), she’s also got the best Super Rare Crit Bonus as her Ship Ability, thanks to a faster cool down than Ardra! It’s hard to believe that that torch has been passed after Ardra’s epic run as part of many standard Ship Battle metas for so long. For those of us who have already moved on to the Demo Man Scotties, Voxes, and Captain Tuvoks of the world for all our Crit needs, she offers some pretty healthy upside in the future Collection Department and is certainly worth your considerations for those reasons alone should she pop up for you in a Behold one day.
