“O, then, I see High Teer Maab hath been with you.
He is the Capellan's Warrior, and he comes
In shape no bigger than a topaline stone,
On the fore-finger of a Klingon mining slave,
Drawn with a team of little power-cats
Athwart women's noses as they give birth;”

While it remains unclear if those are apple-bottom jeans, Maab certainly brings boots with the fur to our dear mobile game. He also brings yet another permutation of CMD/DIP/Suck in his aggressively average debut. Joining the logjam that is the top 15 or so crew in the SEC Base ranks, he offers nothing unique there other than stellar fashion. His traits and skill order can add a small touch of variety to an elderly player’s Voyage lineup, but he will really only have impact on rosters that don’t already have one of his peers. Newer players will benefit from him should they get a copy as he is, in a vacuum, somewhat strong, however this vacuum has already (CMD/DIP) sucked up plenty of other crew in the game. Julie Newmar (me-ow!) has nothing to worry about, as this Teer is easily replaced.
