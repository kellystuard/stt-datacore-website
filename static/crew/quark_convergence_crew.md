Traits are the name of the game for the appropriately dice-rolly Quark. A few 45%+ Gauntlets give him the rare chance to shine there (if you're not philosophically opposed to 2-skillers) and power much of his Event potential. Naturally that has extended to Collections, both his six existing and possible three more in the future, and give him an opportunity to grow in value over time, even if he'll never be a daily use piece outside of Fleet Boss Battle Node solving.
