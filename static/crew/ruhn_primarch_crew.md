There was a time when a CMD/DIP/SUCK new Legendary with a Voyage Rating debuting in the mid 200s would be universally panned…but those days are over! Why?! Well, Ruhn here has some Gauntlet! 

TPG has been adding Gauntlet-viable Crew with more regularity now with the advent of Goyages, and that’s good news for Gauntlet-enjoyers everywhere. Mr. Ruhn, Primarch if you’re nasty, debuts in the top twenty rated Gauntleteers, and has elevated Crit chances in 34 Gauntlets, including 14 at 45% or higher. We wish his Trait list was meatier to translate into more Collection and Event chances, but we may just need to wait for the payoff from viable Traits such as Tactician, Crafty, Duelist, and Scoundrel to cash in. Plus, he’s holding a cool stick. Is it called a truncheon? Yeah, I think that’s it. A truncheon. That’s a cool word.
