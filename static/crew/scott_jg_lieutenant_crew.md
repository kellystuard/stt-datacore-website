Jack of a couple trades, master of none? Offering something notable but unimpressive in nearly every area, nuScotty leaves one thinking, “I’m sure a new player would use him somewhere.”

Tragically, Montgomery Scott’s variants lack across the board in event and trait metrics which will hamstring any crew who doesn’t have eye-wateringly strong stats on debut. Martin Quinn’s introductory incarnation does pick up a handful of niches between a charging shipboard damage ability and strong-enough ENG base, but it will indeed be up to a newer player to determine if Scotty can slap some flex tape over their early game roster needs before being shunted into the cryostasis as a collection notch for the rest of us.
