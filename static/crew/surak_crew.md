Kids these days are going to see a juicy Collection piece and never know what an all-star Surak was on release. A top five Voyage and Gauntlet option then, he's still held on to a little value.

With a healthy portion of Stats allocated to Proficiencies, he's a great if not overpowering Gauntlet pick. Twenty-plus elevated Crit sets including a trio of 45%ers is plenty of crit to bring to bear in combination with three healthy Proficiency rolls. His Skill set shoots the gap between Balok's CMD/DIP, Armus' CMD/SCI, and Loco's DIP/SCI, displaying the dominance of none of those Exclusives, but offering plus versatility if you're still trying to make inroads in that competitive area of the game.

With a lovely capstone in the form of a Collection quintet and a few more viable Traits in hand, Surak remains among the best cards in the game and taken for granted due to his status as an old Mega Recurring Legendary crew.
