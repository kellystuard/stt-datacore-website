It's funny how SCI bases go. Sometimes the crown is held by one of the most iconic Starfleet captains to ever hold the rank, debuting in a new hit series coming exclusively to Paramount Plus (subscribe now!), other times it's held by mysterious ancient humanoids that look suspiciously like Changelings and give explanations for why 95% of classic Trek alien designs have rubber foreheads. Sometimes it's a one-off redshirt played by Diana Muldaur, it's all a rich tapestry. And now . . . it's Bryce. Well, okay then.

For those of you wondering, yes, that is Discovery's communications officer Ronald Altman Bryce now swaggering around with the #1 SCI base - for how long, it's unclear, but it's now a fact that it happened at least once in the history of Timelines. Unsurprisingly, that's where the majority of his long term value is going to come from, so if you love big bases, then you other brothers best not deny and go for him.

For those of us who don't wish to get sprung, however, you should be wary of investing in a crew that arrives with his collections borderline tapped out and voyage metrics that list multiple outperformers on all his AM seats. The ENG kicker gives him the kind of niche relevance that kept similar Disco bridge crew member Honored Owosekun alive on Datacore for so long, but it's a really very tenuous lifeline indeed, and you'd frankly be better off just investing in the rarer permutations of this skill set. ENG/CMD, SCI/ENG, even - anything but the dreaded SCI/CMD. If you decide to immortalise him, you're tacking into a strong wind indeed, so make sure your needs aren't better served elsewhere before you do it. Just ask Dr. Ann Mulhall how she's doing right now if you want to see how things pan out when big base is all you're chasing.
