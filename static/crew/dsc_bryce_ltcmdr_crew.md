Another ancillary bridge crew from Discovery to get a Legendary Crew inclusion in the game, Rhys… I mean Bryce… has lost his top SCI Base twice since debut and I’ve lost all interest in his characterization. Well, if I had any in the first place, I would have lost it.

What else does Bryce have to offer the discerning Timelines player? Well, not much really. The Voyage power has sagged, the Event chances don’t register on our sensors, and there’s no Gauntlet viability or Ship Ability worth anything. Four Collections, still a little above average at the time of this writing, and one more solitary viable Trait in his back pocket, is really all that’s left to look at here.
