Why couldn’t they be called L’ak & Moll? It flows so much better, and think of the pun possibilities. Ah well, like this happy couple and their erigah, we have to take the cards we’re dealt.

This Fusion pair roll ‘n’ rocks their way to the top of the Voyage charts on launch! Is this some kind of Breen plot to force all players to try to capture them? You will absolutely not want to miss on an opportunity to obtain and save a copy of both regular Moll (a 5* Legendary) and regular L’ak (a 4* Super Rare) in order to fuse them. Use citations on them if needed (remember, one of the two needs to be fully fused, and of course we recommend the easier/cheaper L’ak in this case), because this is a crew you want to own ASAP. If the Voyage score wasn’t good enough, there’s even Gauntlet use (hello Voyage Events!) and a Shuttle-worthy DIP base! Break a thousand laws if you have to in order to get this pair onto your roster.
