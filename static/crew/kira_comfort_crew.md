We were all hoping "Comfort Woman Kira" would bust out some badass catch phrase like "Comfort this!" and kick Dukat and that fat, creepy Cardassian out a hole in the side of Terok Nor. It didn't happen, but in game she's still someone to hide behind when the fighting breaks out. 

Unfortunately, sharing the dreaded CMD/DIP/SEC triplet with her big sister Breen Disguise Kira and a plethora of other crew well ahead of her in raw Voyage power means that this variant is unfortunately aged out of viable use on that game mode.

But all the news ainâ€™t bad - Kira's mouth-watering Trait set measures seven deep without being bloated by the top five largest pools including Human, Federation, or Starfleet. That's generally a clear signal that a crew is likely to either improve with age or at least decline less rapidly as her Traits trigger Collections and Event bonuses in the future, and they are already bearing fruit with three Collection entries, with possibly four more to come.
