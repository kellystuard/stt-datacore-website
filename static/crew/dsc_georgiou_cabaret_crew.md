What good is sitting alone with your Dil? 
Come hear the whales pay, 
Six packs are a cabaret, old chum, 
Come to the Cabaret! 

Put down the Event Crew, the Giveaways and the Campaigns, 
It's time for a holiday, 
Six Packs are a cabaret, old chum! 
Come to the Cabaret! 

Come taste the CMD! 
Come hear the DIP! 
Come blow chunks at the SUCK, start self-flagellating! 
Right this way, your mediocre Crew's waiting! 

What good's permitting some Big Booker of doom, 
To wipe every smile away, 
Six Packs are a cabaret, old chum, 
So come to the Cabaret!
