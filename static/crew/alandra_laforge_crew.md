With prodigal daughter Sidney hogging the Legendary giveaway spot, Alandra was destined from the beginning to be the forgotten sibling. Her ENG primary base is strong enough to be a thaw-able option for Faction events, but her event history will continue to be a wasteland with no variants forthcoming and an extremely humdrum trait set. Her most notable usage will likely be some fast-activating shipboard crit bonus, though it’s certainly not an offering you’d struggle to find elsewhere.
