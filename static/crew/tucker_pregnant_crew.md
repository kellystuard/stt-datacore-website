I am practically glowing, having long expected this bundle of joy to be birthed into the game.

Unfortunately, our new bouncing baby boy got dropped on his head a few times.

ENG/DIP/SCI is a great description for Trip, as he is an Engineer first, a diplomatic envoy from the Enterprise to help the Xyrellians second, and a brave scientist who experienced a working holodeck years before Quark could charge you bars of Latinum to use third. Sadly, he ranks behind recent giveaways like Phantasms Data or Exoarchaeologist Mariner in this skillset when order doesn't matter. Despite six Antimatter Trait seats, Tucker will find more use playing four-handed games with aliens before he will star in Voyages for elderly players.

Occasionally there will be an Event that he will ride a shuttle on, or one that will occupy your stronger crew allowing Tucker to maybe push his stroller onto a mid-event Voyage. Beyond that and his two Collections at launch (and the possibility of twins in the future), Trip is probably going to become a stay-at-home dad.

But the most important takeaway here is â€“ HE WAS A COMPLETE GENTELMAN THE ENTIRE TIME.

You know, now that I think about it, I have been feeling kind of queasy in the mornings...
