Yes, he’s CMD/DIP/SUCK, but he wears it so well! Or is that the tasteful black Admiral’s uniform that the first Captain of the Enterprise is pulling off?!

Robert April is helping to shatter the Trek “badmiral” trope in Strange New Worlds, and he’ll find use for you in many areas of the game with this Legendary variant, introduced in the December 2023 Mega Event as the Recurring Crew. Strong enough to Voyage despite the overstuffed Skill set and order he’s been saddled with, Robert also bakes in a trio of debut Collections to his value, but without much else on his Trait list as a follow-up for later. 

WRG/TPG/whoever has really leaned into the Hull Repair meta for Fleet Boss Battles, putting out crew after crew with serviceable Ship Abilities to help you time out the Doomsday Device. April is the latest - a 20s Cycle and a 25% Hull Repair ability, which is the ideal percentage and timing, but with an Accuracy Boost instead of the ideal Attack Boost. That being said, for a newer player or for one who doesn’t want to spend effort and resources Retrieving or buying other Hull Repair Crew, he falls right in your lap.
