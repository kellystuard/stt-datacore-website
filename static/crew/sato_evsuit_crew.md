In an ideal world, these are the stat ranks you’re looking for on a crew you immortalized a year or two ago, but for Hoshi Sato, we’ll take what we can get. Boasting reasonable utility headlined by a strong collection profile, Sato is likely a name you’ll be starring up down the line as she increments towards seven or so collections. Meaning that if you can add those stars now to get a little voyage and shuttle use, so much the better.

Hoshi’s DIP/SEC/SCI skill set has seen a lot of competition in recent years, especially made available from megas and notably the Faction store. While she has some noteworthy metrics, her usefulness on your roster will hinge on how current you are and how complete your roster is.
