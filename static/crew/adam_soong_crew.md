The latest installment in Brent Spiner’s Soongography, Adam was weirdly obsessed with the goddess Persephone. Seriously, his daughter’s names are: Persephone, an epithet for Persephone, a variant of the name Persephone, a slight misspelling of the Latin name for Persephone, Persephone’s half-sister, and yet another name for Persephone. Took one Classics course in undergrad and now he’s just unbearable.

Definitely not a variant of Adam (ahem, you need to fix your hidden tags, WRG), this Soong continues the tradition of Soongs not being particularly great in the game. He does, at least, have a BigBase™ SCI score to ensure that he’s not complete dead on arrival, however this is really it. A rare 425% instant damage is taken down a peg thanks to a two shot limit and eight second initialization (two seconds slower than all the meta options), and his two trait-based Continuum Equipment both only affect his tertiary skill. If you’re someone who only buys the ÜberKampaign track when the Legendary crew is worth it, this is an easy skip. If you’re contemplating him in a future BeGold, take him only if there aren’t better options available. Good art though? Brent Spiner’s appearance as Data may not have aged too well, but without the makeup he’s a bit of a silver fox.
