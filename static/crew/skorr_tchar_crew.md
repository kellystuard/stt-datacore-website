Who knows how Tchar can fly with all that swag weighing him down, but Aleek-Om is all grown up and ready to eat your Gauntlet opponents alive and regurgitate them for his young.

A strong but not elite force among Super Rare Gauntleteers, Tchar is something like EV Suit Picard or Braxton's little brother in that area. His weak Trait set doesn't do him a lot of favors for dice rolling, but the raw Proficiency power is certainly something that early-to-midgame rosters may wish to go out of their way to grab one star of as a bridge to the overpowered Exclusive crew.

Weak Bases aren't an issue in this case as his unfavorable lineup of Eventable Traits haven't shown up much on the weekend anyways and are probably better as ticking clock future Collections. His big Instant Damage Ship Ability, sequestered behind a Position Trigger and slow activation time, is another one star option for newer players. Tchar profiles as a great crew to snag the first copy of in Beholds, but until the Collection winds shift, take your time adding his later stars.
