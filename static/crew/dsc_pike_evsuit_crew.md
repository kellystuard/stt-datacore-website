EV Pike's SEC leads the way here - strong for Super Rares and paired with some plus Traits that should grant him weekend bonuses. The name Pike has a future as bright as any other due to Strange New Worlds, making him a likely Event star. SEC and “CMD and SEC” seats litter the majority of Events and his power + Skill eligibility should have him at the top of every thaw list for which he has a bonus.

Holding down a handful of Collection spots and with a ceiling of six, Pike is peak long-term value and shouldn't have much trouble finding Faction action down the line.
