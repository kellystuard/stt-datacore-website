"Better than every other Sulu combined", shouted the newspaper boy in his flat cap. That headline may sell papers, but realistically it only makes Tribble Sulu a competitive option overall. That's still great news, even if no new ground is being broken with this crew. 

Sulu's new age CMD/DIP/SEC skill set is a hair better than that dreaded triplet, but unfortunately like most two year old crew he is almost DOA on Voyages.  The STT Original also picks up a trio of Collections and is far from the worst option for any of them, plus look out for the inevitable addition of up to two more.

Event work will be spotty at best, but a few nice Traits and operational base should afford him a few chances to shine in the future and give him multiple angles of contribution.
