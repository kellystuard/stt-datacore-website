The latest crew enjoying the festivities at the Riker-Troi wedding in Nemesis, Festive Guinan raises a glass to those stalwart Timelines enjoyers willing to throw down 25 or so regional currency units for the Uberkampaign. 

Throwing a quick comparison your way for contemporary readers of this note when originally penned, Guinan demolishes Event Reward Quality of Mercy Chapel in the same Skill set, but the MED Skill slips on Guinan’s triplet from Secondary to Tertiary, making her a little less desirable overall. Is Guinan the crowd favorite like Jess Bush’s Chapel is? Maybe not, but it doesn’t mean Whoopi’s portrayal of the mysterious, ageless El-Aurian is any less masterful.

Supplanting recent ÜberKampaign Legendary Night Terrors Troi atop her Skill Triplet, Guinan has enough power to overcome only four Antimatter Seats on Voyages, and her trio of debut Collections place her solidly in the “average” range there. Two further edge case Traits may round her out to a full handful one day, but we wouldn’t count on it. And, since WRG have continued to hammer the Hull Repair Meta into the ground for Fleet Boss Battles, Guinan also has a 25% Hull Repair Ship Ability with a just-worse-than-best-in-class 22s cycle time, but with a less tasty Accuracy Boost instead of the delectable Attack Boost we all wanted.
