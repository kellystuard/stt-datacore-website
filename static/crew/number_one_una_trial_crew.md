Keeping the appropriate theming intact for her debut event along with Batel and Neera, Una on Trial is a Super Rare variant and notedly the first variant of Una/Number One with her (spoilers!) Illyrian racial Trait. Splitting hairs on Trait is what we do here at the Big Book, so we must question briefly (and academically since WRG doesn’t do any regular or consistent Trait Audits) whether Una should still have her Human Trait as she presents with a Human appearance, or where her Engineered Trait is. All that aside, Una on Trial is a solid Super Rare with a common top two Skills, still-usable Voyage power for the early game, and a possibility of up to four Collections, with only a quarter of that value already baked in. 

Her best attribute may be her Ship Ability, an impressive 350% Instant Damage Ability, not really hamstrung by a Position Trigger since the best Super Rare Ship (Borg Sphere 878) has that Ability, alongside a +8 Attack Boost and a quick Cycle. That being said, it’s not very unique, since recent releases Lenore Karidian, Hain, Devore, and Abducted Travis, have a similar ability, and several older crew already in the Time Portal (Bat’leth Mariner, Skorr Tchar) are comparable as well.
