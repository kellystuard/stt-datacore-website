A half dozen viable Traits is just the right amount to get our insect parts rubbing together in anticipation. They've already done their job in bolstering Sevenâ€™s Event portfolio, resulting in more 5+ Event years than not. With "regular" Seven Events in the mix and a strong Skill set for Shuttles, Tsunkatse is a name to keep in the back of your mind for periodic Thaws.

As her Collection count grows, Seven will only become a more attractive card for mid-to-late game players and she should hold value for quite a while.
