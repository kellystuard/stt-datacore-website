I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating the devs’ huge, misshapen heads to pulp. Thoughts so primitive they black out everything else. I'm filling my mind with hate.

Ok, I won’t go full Hunter, but… The third Pike in nearly as many weeks. All kinda voyage-y, all kinda event-y. Great. That’s great. So why do we need this one? Can’t be for his big SEC, previous Pike does it better. His SCI? Nope, a two year old giveaway is still holding that down.

The truth is, he was a twinkle in some dev’s eye who may have been part of the big 2023 staff layoffs because he was sitting in the game files with abysmal stats, but despite being buffed right before release, they didn’t go far enough.

So he’s tier whatever with stats that might work on some rosters, but so utterly uninspired with TP’s classic card release anti-timing that this seminal moment in Trek history ends up a total wash, tacked onto a statistical framework which will soon be forgotten until some new guy posts in Discord looking to get the best out of a bad behold.
