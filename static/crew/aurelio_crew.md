“For Aurelio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.”

Sadly, Kenneth Mitchell lost his battle with ALS earlier in 2024. It’s a really shitty disease, and this is a lackluster tribute to him. Props to the franchise for continuing to work with him and accommodating his condition in a pretty creative way. Grab a copy if you’re a fan, but that’s about the only reason to do so.
