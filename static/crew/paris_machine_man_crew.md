"All trades are final."

Uh oh gang, sounds like trouble is a-brewin’ for the crew of ol’ Voyager! And by trouble, I mean Tom leaving Harry hanging out to dry for a holodeck date and we the viewer missing out on more Captain Proton fun. Dick.


Courtesy of Alice and her desire to spend more time playing mobile Star Trek games, Interfaced Paris joins us with an appropriately strong Shuttle capability. While ENG seats are limited and therefore so is Tom’s daily use, and many players will have already unlocked Demo Man Scotty via Fleet Boss Battles (or will, with persistence and a cooperative Fleet…you can do it!), Events will be your friend. Tom here is a favourite fallback for WRG, practically guaranteed to hit two Faction or Faction/Galaxy Hybrid Events a year based on Variant alone, not to mention popular traits such as Engineered, Pilot, and Prisoner just to name a few.

Conditioned Tom also brings some niche Gauntlet use thanks to his ENG/SCI top pairing, meaning Paris fans can seat him frequently without feeling like they are sacrificing power for love. He won’t get you much work elsewhere, however, as his Ship Ability is buried behind a Position Trigger just like pretty much everyone with a double digit +Attack. Gauntlet is only an afterthought, but of course he was all talk in this episode and didn’t put up much of a fight anyway.

A must-have for Paris fans and a nice-to-have for everyone else who can spare the roster spot, feel confident knowing that despite not being a game changer in any regard, he will have some occasional use either for an early adopter (see benefits above), or as someone picking him up later thanks to some strong potential for future Collections. Of course, some may even want him for that pube-y facial hair. I’d comment more on that, but my mother said if I don’t have something nice to say I shouldn’t say anything at all.
