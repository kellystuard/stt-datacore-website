It’s hard to make a solid argument against taking any Kira at this point, but is this or is this not a Kira? Well, yes and no, but yes in all the ways it is important in the game. This Changeling version of Kira, awarded in the Uberkampaign, counts as a Kira for Events, and has all the important Kira Traits, plus a few extra ones for fun! Despite only having three Collections on debut, you can reasonably count on seeing two more, with an outside chance of a further two after that, making her a solid long-term investment from that perspective. 

In the short term, if you were to add a fifth star to Immortalize this Faux Kira, you’d find yourself with a strong Voyager for a good while, at the top of her Skill Order (elusive Voyage Exclusive Grady notwithstanding), and slotting in nicely among the top crew in her Triplet like Kashyk and EV Suit Uhura. 

Kira Events are always in vogue and Changeling’s big Primary and Secondary Bases being common Shuttle Seating Skills will give her immense value on the weekends. So, if you are a Uberkampaign Enjoyer, this is a nice crew bonus to your purchase.
