Counselor Neeta Ketoul’s opposite number in Una’s court martial trial, the first variant of Captain Marie Batel is a Super Rare and a fine one at that. While we pour one out for the deleted “Advocate” Trait, we can still count four viable Traits, of which half have Collections on this crew’s debut. Batel’s raw Voyage power dulls the blow of the dreaded CMD/DIP/SUCK Skill set, but you’ll be glad you have it if her Traits hit the weekend Event bonus roulette and her sizeable CMD and DIP Bases pitch in on your rental Shuttles. Yet another recent “Ardra-lite” Ship Ability (+12000 Crit Bonus at 6s) but with a limit of 2 uses will make her useful for your early-game Skirmish and Arena teams.
