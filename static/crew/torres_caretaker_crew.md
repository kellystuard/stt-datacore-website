Recovering from the Caretaker’s gentle embrace (of invasive genetic testing) on the planet Ocampa is this variant of B'elanna Torres, so named because WRG sometimes has no better ideas to name a crew than to include the name of the episode.

Summer 2023 is the “Summer of Torres”: a party-going Luau variant and this UberKampaign Legendary to tickle the shekels from your digital wallet and into WRG’s coffers. Is she worth 25 or so regional currency units? Outside the ancillary benefits of the super premium Campaign, B’elanna is nearly a carbon copy of Hollow Data (who again, we remind people is not hollow at all), and is just behind former Campaign crew EV Suit Tendi in her Skill set. Strong Voyage ability, uncommon Skill set, and quintet of Antimatter Traits make her attractive for daily use.

Somewhat thinly Traited, carrying the non-standard Torres Trait of Prisoner but missing the more standard Jury Rigger, she’ll top out at three or four Collections when all is said and done.

WRG’s concerted effort to LEAN IN to the Fleet Boss Battles Hull Repair meta also intensifies here, since they’ve given Caretaker Torres a 25% Hull Repair Ship Ability at a slightly slower 22s (for reference Dereth and peers are at 20s), but that is serviable with enough Captain’s Bridge buffs.
