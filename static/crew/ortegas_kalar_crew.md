This Ortegas sadly has the stench of her Off-Duty variant all over her. Yes, Ensign, it’s all over her. Identical skill sets and equally short on viable traits, choosing to flood her list with several labels that will never see collections and rarely events.

Kalar trades out Off-Duty’s longer-lasting gauntlet prowess for mid-level voyage work, particularly in the Pilot and Undercover Operative seats, her only two traits that truly matter. They’re also her lifelines to any collection value, a SNW show grouping notwithstanding. With an extremely scant event history for this X year old game, Erica can’t even scrape much weekend work together to supplement a primary base that debuts outside of the top twenty. This card has all the hallmarks of an event weekend to skip and a behold choice to avoid.
