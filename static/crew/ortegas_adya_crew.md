It’s always nice of WRG to release new Crew in Tuesday Packs, especially when they fill a desired new Vanity Collection. Thankfully, it’s literally just vanity for the Elysian Kingdom Collection since there (as of yet) is no Collection Exclusive Crew at the end of the rainbow like Lucille Davenport, Data and Spot, or Scapegoat O’Brien.

Erica Ortegas flies the ship, and Sir Adya swings the sword? Nice ring to it, right? Excellent art hides the lack of daily use for this Super Rare Crew, since she debuts far below the usual Voyage power for her Rarity. Thankfully, her Trait list makes up for the lack of utility otherwise, with a debut in a quartet of Collections (including the aforementioned Vanity Collection), and perhaps one more later. 

Arena nerds might try to find a use for her Ship Ability, which is 250% Instant Damage with a Cloak Trigger. Have fun with that!
