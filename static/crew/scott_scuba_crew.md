If you’ve just woken up from your 2017 coma and can’t wait to play some Timelines, you might be shocked to see Super Rares now sport dual 1k bases with bonuses. Wild.

Scotty has, as the kids would say, aura. But this faithful meld of cartoon and live action isn’t designed to distract, in fact Scuba Scotty is a fine addition to your early game lineup.

His top thirty voyage, top ten base debut ranks speak for themselves in terms of daily utility and he ties for the Super Rare lead with 18,000 crit bonus, doing a fair approximation of the long-venerated Arda in ship battles. His collection quartet is an afterthought at this point in the game’s life cycle, but is still a nice motivation to immortalize when possible.
