A serious workhorse for however long your Uncommon Crew are in play, Mariner is the daily use Übermensch, debuting atop the Base and Voyage ranks with some nice Instant Damage on Ships to boot.

Mariner should have no problem handling Cadet Missions four days a week thanks to a tremendous CMD Primary and a SECondary big enough to Crit its share of Nodes too. While her relative lack of Traits hamstrings her on the Galaxy Map, she’s managed to gather up a pair of non-Rarity Collections to buoy her value.
