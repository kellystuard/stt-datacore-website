Essentially a launch card, Mirror Kirk’s woeful Bases are understandable, though it doesn’t make his card any better. A weak option in almost every area, he can at least claim a vigorous Event tally on the back of the Kirk brand and fistfuls of Mirror Universe bonuses. Considering the commonality of CMD and SEC seating, this variant should be fine to ship out on some of your later Shuttles.

If you’ve had the misfortune of selecting Kirk as the best choice in a bad Behold early on in your Timelines journey, his trio of 45% Gauntlets could allow him to make a dent in CMD/SEC matchups - then again, maybe we’re blowing smoke up your rear while Balok laughs in the distance.
