Anniversaru debuted to great fanfare as a giveaway plus three copies in an Endurance Objective Event, and due to his strong initial power, most players got a solid two years of utilization. These days, Saru enjoys enduring value due to his Event/Collection pedigree; a quintet of Collections plus perhaps one more viable Trait gives him above-average metrics in that area, and a combination of variant, show, and Trait-based Events couple well with an ideal Skill set for Shuttles. Returning Saru is a fine choice to choose in a Legendary Behold or slap near the top of your Crew Retrieval list if you are hunting global Stat boosts.
