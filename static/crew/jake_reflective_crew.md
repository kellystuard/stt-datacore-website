After a seven year journey across the Promenade, Deep Space Nine comes to a close with Jake Sisko and Kira admiring – looking – reflecting – on the friends they’ve lost. Sadly, that bittersweet moment is captured in Timelines with the literal reflection of Jake from the glass window he was looking out…and from the looks of the art, the glass had a few smudges on it.

For a Super Rare entry into ‘Timelines Event Crew you can freeze on a Monday’, Jake will have plenty of time to reflect on his lackluster offering – okayish Voyage power, a promise of a once-a-year Faction event with a bonus trait match, and a meager three Collections. If you’re looking for redemption in Quipment or Shuttle or Gauntlet use, sadly you’re wishing on the wrong star. Oh, and his art is, well, let’s just say Cirroc can’t sue for likeness rights. 

Use your monthly Campaign Purple Cite and send “Jake” to be with his father.
