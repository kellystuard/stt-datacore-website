Crashing a Tuesday Pack near you, it’s Spock as T’Pring! Wait, is it T’Pring as Spock? Spock as Spock? T’Pring as T’Pring? I’m as confused as this plot device from “Spock Amok” in Season 1 of Strange New Worlds!

In any sense, she (yes, she, as this crew has the female hidden Trait), counts as both a Spock AND a T’Pring for Events (yes, ALL those T’Pring Events we’ve been having), and has a middling set of Traits to cash in on for Events, Voyage Antimatter seats, Collections, and Fleet Boss Battles Node unlocks (yes, this game is all Traits, if you haven’t been paying ANY attention). Look to see her top out at three likely Collections, which is about average for a crew in the game by now.

Strong Voyage debut power is slightly hamstrung by a common Skill set, but at least she has the good graces to enter the game as the top in her Skill order, but is merely eighth when order is not considered (see, we said it was common).

Of course Spock Events are evergreen, so look for her to catch them at least a few times a year (low point was three in 2022), and the DIP Base (yes, ANOTHER DIP-Primary) is good enough to make non-bonus Shuttles when you’re sending waves of requisition ones with Tokens.

The coup de grace for T’Pring as Spock is her Ship Ability, and oh boy is it a good one. A gigantic chunk of Crit Bonus (+20,000) with +10 to Attack, with a better Cycle Time and similar Uptime, is a direct upgrade to Demo Man Scotty, Fleet Boss Battles stalwart since day one of the Feature. That Crit Bonus bundle is 25% more than Scotty and may improve your Boss Damage considerably. Consider carefully putting Legendary Citations on her for this reason alone!
