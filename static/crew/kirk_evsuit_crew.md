The first appearance of the dreaded Tholian Web also brings us this absolute gem of late 1960s futurism design. The accent colours, the neighbour-peering-over-the-fence clunkiness of the helmet…if this wasn’t the inspiration for Dr. Evil’s environmental suit decades later I don’t know what was.

But I digress. EV Suit Kirk is more than a man in an interphase loop, he debuts as the number 1 Super Rare Voyager at the time of writing! That’s right, move on over…Ensign Hoya. Kirk here brings a healthy CMD/ENG pairing that should tide you over for quite a while if you're still lacking for good Legendary crew (in that skill set or just in general) - long live Purple Voyagers who perform like Golds! He’s also one of the top CMD Base SRs with plenty of Event potential available with both his name and his traits. For the Collectors out there (not saying that should be all of you, but it shouldn't NOT be all of you), he’s currently in 2 Stat-Boosting Collections and will help you avoid needing to find, fuse, and level one of the crappy EV Suit golds. Hero and Desperate could find themselves becoming Collections one day soon at the rate WRG keeps dropping them, so while you should never pull 6 packs, kids, we might be able to forgive you on this one.
