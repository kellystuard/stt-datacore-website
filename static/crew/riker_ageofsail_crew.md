Though he has picked up a few Collections and with dreary bases aside, AoS is flying at half mast even with a handful of stars. An overstuffed skill set undercuts a formerly great Voyage ranking that has fallen to far below average. Riker's steady Event tally in combination with a handful of intriguing Traits should give his modest bases relevance into the future, but he's gone from Behold target to consolation prize. Take stars if you must, and hope his Trait sails catch some wind for up to two more Collections.
