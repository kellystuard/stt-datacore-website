Tuvok's wings have been clipped compared to his soaring heights on release. Voyages are beyond his capabilities if you have comparable Skill set/fuse level options and his powerful Attack boost on Ships is slow enough that you can generally find (or Retrieve) better options. 

But there's good value in a multi-Collection piece who also enjoys an event m√®lange of Tuvok, Vulcan, and Borg events while sporting the right Shuttle Skills to boot. There are reasons for almost every roster to snag stars on Tuvok in a behold, even if he does more of his heavy lifting post-cryo these days, especially with two more Traits right in the wheelhouse for new Collections.
