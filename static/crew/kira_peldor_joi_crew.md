A strong option to reinforce your roster, Kira lacks an elite stat, but is serviceable in several areas. A heady event count and with steady weekend work year after year, Kira cards have enjoyed an absurd six years with at least three variant events, many of them with Faction elements. In between those peaks, she debuts with a healthy voyage lead over other options in her skill order making her an occasional performer there throughout the week.

Collections are what bring us joi and set this card apart from the wash of voyage/base options flooding the market. Kira’s over halfway to realizing her collection ceiling of seven-ish and the ones she already appears in are large groups flush with stat boosts. As an event offering, she’s worth pushing your chips into the middle for.
