Siranna has little to offer the player outside the second resurrection of Discovery Mega Events and the associated show Collection from her hidden dsc tag. While one of her remaining Traits is a reasonable assumption to find itself a Stat-boosting Collection one day, Siranna is Behold Insuranceâ„¢ at best and a Crew Slot squatter at worst.
