We’re not sure how slapping the word ‘Bridge’ onto a crew automatically makes their stats really good (sorry, Will), but no complaints here. Someone at TP seems to have a level of reverence for Picard & Co.’s last hurrah on board the ‘D and Bev is the latest in that model, this time snagging a bit of exclusivity as a voyage-only drop.

There isn’t much to *dis*like here, aside from the lack of a lay-up CMD/MED pairing. Crusher has the requisite base power to pair with her stop-and-start event history, enough collections for those targeting juicy global skill buffs, and even shipboard damage that might save a new player a retrieval if they luck into her early on.

Most impressive, though, is her voyage profile. TP has sprinkled in Bev’s SEC/SCI/ENG skill set recently to bring a power refresh of Lapsed Leucon and Middling Mestral, but Crusher is easily the best of the bunch. Her antimatter hit rate is excellent (top ten for a non-MED crew) and her exact skill order consists mostly of seven year old gauntlet cards who were barely passable voyagers when that feature first launched.

While we’d still recommend players choose Admiral Black or perhaps Simple Simon from their voyage behold, Bev at least makes a strong argument for your consideration.
