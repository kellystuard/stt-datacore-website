If you’re just here for the numbers, grab a chair in the back - we’ll get there in a minute. Robbie kicked off the “Player’s Choice” Mega Event with unsubstantiated scientific acumen and the Voyage prowess of a man who does more than “haul his butt back and forth between starbases”. He’s frankly a Frankenstein of a crew, but at least he’s got the numbers and, hey, what else matters?

Slowly but surely, DeSoto is aging out of Voyages, but his few Antimatter seats are helping to stave off Power Creep™, if only for a little while.

Solid with Base numbers too, DeSoto’s probably not the first name you grab for non-bonus weekend work, but he might snag a Mega Event here or there via his thin Trait pool. Ardra-esque on Ships, there are surely angles for DeSoto to contribute on your roster, even if you have to Google the sixty second scene he comes from.
