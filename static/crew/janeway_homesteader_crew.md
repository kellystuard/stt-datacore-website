The lesser half of the Voyager stage play Resolutions joined the game as a mid-power Giveaway in 2020. While we wait for Bathtub, Man's Man Chakotay to join her (hopefully forever, in placid paradise), how much does Janeway have left in the tub? Tank, sorry.

Sitting atop a mountain of Janeway variants with SCI should ensure evergreen Faction opportunities for Homesteader, which is truer for her character than any other as Janeway boasts a 75% Faction rate for her Events. Contributing rare MED Skill among Legendary variants gives her another Shuttle market to corner too.

Gone from daily use on Voyages, turn to her Collections next. Front-loaded with a trio of Collections to round her out, Janeway is a competitive mid-level Legendary Behold option whom you should be pleased to add stars to, but no longer has the stat power to command Citation consideration.
