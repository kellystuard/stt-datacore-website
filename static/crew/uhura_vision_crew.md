Thank god WRG changed the name of this crew, since she was initially announced to be in the SNW/Explorer Mega Event as “S2 Uhura”. Uhura in Visions steps out of the stylistically-interesting mist in her crew art into a more-than-solid Tier 2 debut rating, helped out by capable Bases, plus Voyage power and Skill order, and a Spockish Event pedigree. A trio of Collections and one more Trait for later gives her above average marks in that important measure for Super Rares, and if she had any Gauntlet utility or a Ship Ability that wasn’t pedestrian Cloak Trigger-locked Instant Damage, she’d be a vision of Tier 1 for sure.
