Finished with my Keiko 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind.
People think I'm insane ‘cause I’m drinking coffee all the time.

All week long I think of things but no one seems to let me try.
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't warn them that they all may die.

Can you help me,
Figure out what’s wrong?
Oh yeah.

I need someone to give me Collections that I cannot find.
I can't use my traits to boost your skills in-game, I must be blind.

Paradans joke and they must die, and Sisko begs, and Kira cries.
Confusion is all I feel and life to me is so unreal.

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state.
Tell Keiko I love her so, I wish I could but it's too late.
