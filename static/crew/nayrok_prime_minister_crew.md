A pre-Cochrane Cromwell sighting, Nayrok is the Prime Minister of the Angosians, notedly the race that genetically engineered Roga Danar. Him being the second Angosian to enter the game, look forward to the inevitable Fleet Boss Battles Angosian Nodes once he is added to the Time Portal. Until then, he can hang out in Cryostasis and give you a +1 on his two current Collections.
