Please inform the Legaran Delegation that Sarek of Vulcan is a silver fox. And when you work for 93 years to secure a meeting of this importance, you need to look good doing it. Retro TOS aesthetic with more modern TNG fabrics, Sarek would be just at home on a catwalk as he is in a conference room.

Eye candy aside, LDS (not a Mormon joke or a Lower Decks joke, I promise) sports a classic and overdone DIP/CMD top pairing. Lucky for him, however, he combines better than average Base numbers with one of the most Event-loved trait lists of all time thanks to counting as a Picard as well as a Sarek! Simply put, while you may already have great crew for these Events, he’ll do it all in one convenient package, er I mean roster spot. Not good enough in any other aspect of the game to secure a full BB endorsement, he’s by no means a must have and you are probably better off waiting for his appearance in a BeGold once he’s in the Portal. However, fans of the art and/or character who secure him early can take comfort in his existing four Collections and know that there may even be a couple more down the road.
