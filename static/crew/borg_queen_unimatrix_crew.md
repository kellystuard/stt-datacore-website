Nearly sued by a certain American pie company, we can confirm that Nobody Doesn’t Like Unimatrix Zero Borg Queen. Frankly, I’d have gone for a catchier slogan, but that’s neither here nor there. Six debut collections is instant catnip for late-game players and encompasses all they’re really looking for out of new Super Rares. But Oh, Susanna there’s a lot more for those new to Timelines to enjoy.

Triggerless instant damage is always welcome for fresh rosters, her plethora of traits have afforded her a great event clip to match a worth primary base, and those traits also combine with a plus skill set and power level to make her a strong voyage option before your fused Legendaries come online.

Event for this crew, behold this crew, cite this crew.
