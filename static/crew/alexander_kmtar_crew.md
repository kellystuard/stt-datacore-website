Value for this member of the Sloyan Rat Pack is down to the one-two punch of Collections and Events. The former finds him with a quarter of inclusions plus possibly one or two more, and the Events that go with them give him opportunities to pitch in on the occasional SCI or DIP seat on Shuttles. Not a bad Behold choice overall.
