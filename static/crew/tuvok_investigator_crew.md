Tim Russ is, I think, second to Michael Dorn for the amount of different Trek series and appearances for the same character – or at least someone who looks like the same guy. You had ‘Not Tuvok’ in Star Trek VI, as he worked aboard the Excelsior. Then, you had ‘Not Tuvok’ in Star Trek: Generations, as he worked aboard the ‘Not Excelsior’ Enterprise B. Then, you had “Not Tuvok” as he attempted to hijack the Enterprise D. Don’t forget about “Not Tuvok” but probably was Tuvok from an episode of Deep Space Nine in the Mirror Universe. Oh yeah! He was also ‘Not Tuvok but an evil alien pretending to be Tuvok’ on Star Trek: Picard, before he was just Tuvok on Star Trek: Picard…oh and I guess he was on a few episodes of Voyager or something.

But now! Now Tuvok is truly immortalized in cartoon form, as Tuvok comes to us from Lower Decks! You remember, that 2 second flashback when Captain Freeman was telling a story and he appeared to serve as a plot device and say no lines? Yep, Legendary crew with a month long Objective Event!

Cartoovok (I’ve applied for trademarks on that one) enters your Crew Quarters with one free copy, and 3 more earned with tasks you can complete over a months long period. Sure, he isn’t the best Gauntlet fighter, he doesn’t have a real Ship Ability to speak of, and his Voyage power isn’t huge for a lot of long time players, but four copies of a Legendary is always welcome to any player, unless it’s that one guy that absolutely hates animated Trek and will airlock all of them. My condolences to you, sir. Everyone else – get your copies, cite when you can, and run him through Continuum Missions to get that sweet, delicious Vulcan Quipment applied. Any other course of action would be illogical.
