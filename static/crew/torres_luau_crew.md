Entering the ranks of Crew holding pineapples, to which Malcom Reed is allergic (actually he’s allergic to something the pineapple contains™) is the lovely Luau Torres! A fun Super Rare Crew, she gives you all you need out of cards of that Rarity: Voyage power for early game players, Collections and Traits for mid to late game players, and lovely Roxann Dawson art for all!

For Torres enjoyers, she’s among the best Torres Super Rares with a significant DIP Base, and Torres Events, while we haven’t had one since July 2022, have historically been peppered in liberally. She’s tapped out on her Trait list with three Collections, but it’s hard to ask for a lot more. Party on!
