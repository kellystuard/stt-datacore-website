The Recurring Mega Event Legendary for the Animated Mega Event, Projector Spock anchors a set of new crew from the Very Short Treks, Lower Decks, and the Strange New Worlds/Lower Decks epic crossover event. We’re generally fans of art with props and this is no different, but unlike stand-up/prop comedian Carrot Top, Spock comes with a lot more to offer. Only having little to no utility in the Gauntlet and on Ships, like most Spocks, Projector derives his lasting value from Collections and Events (#FollowTheTraits). Missing a few “classic” Spock Traits but adding a new nontraditional ones, Projector still hits a five-spot for Collections, and has a solid CMD Base for when his number is called on the weekends. Probably an easy Legendary Citation recipient after the Mega Event is over, Spock’s solid Voyage power and Skill set should let him serve admirably there for at least a few months as well.
