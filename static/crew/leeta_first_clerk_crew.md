The companion card to Innovator Rom for your Bridge Crew setups, Chase Masterson’s voice guest star role on Lower Decks delighted us, but her introduction in a Tuesday Pack does the opposite. What’s the reverse of delight? Undelight? Sure. 

Collection enjoyers may have been inclined to splash into these packs for her expansive Trait list, which already has given her a sextet of Collections, and the outside chance to hit a full ten! A long-term Collection investor’s dream! Everything else is gravy, including a 20s Cycle Hull Repair Ship Ability to rival the Dereths of the game for your Fleet Boss Battle loadouts. If you don’t want to spend your premium currency, wait for her to hit the Time Portal and go ahead and Retrieve her; she’ll still have all the value she has now!
