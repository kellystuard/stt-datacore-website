It may not be New York City (unless you’re a Hollywood location scout), but Toronto has all the street chess and hot dog stands a man could ever want! It’s practically their tourism slogan.

Alternate Future Kirk here has never actually been to Earth, but one thing he does have in common with his planetary-born variant is an Event count to make even the most cynical Toronto Maple Leaf fan feel like there is hope in the universe after all. An absolute workhorse in Faction and Galaxy Events past and present, we can expect the future to bring more of the same with a highly popular traits list that reinforces one of the game’s most common Event name variants (and, thanks to Strange New Worlds, he’s on an active show again). These traits don’t actually bring as many Collections as one may like, in a Timelines era where “only” four Stat-Boosting ones is considered nothing more than a good start, but he’ll make up for it with some daily Shuttle utility on less fleshed out rosters and, if nothing else, raise the fashion score of any player who happens to find a copy come their way. This episode may be divisive in how it retcons the Khan Noonien Singh backstory, but can we all agree that Roots makes a mean leather jacket (for inquiries into additional advertising on the Big Book, please contact nonamenamer@profit.now)?
