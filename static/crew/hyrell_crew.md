Having fun isn’t hard, when you’ve got a library card. It might be hard if the library moves every 50 years or so, but a proper book work probably won’t look up often enough to even notice when that happens.

Should you find yourself working for a shady antiquarian archivist, you may find yourself needing to work with Hy’Rell. As finding the Eternal Gallery and Archive is a bit of a voyage in itself, it may not shock you that Hy’Rell knows a thing or two about Voyaging herself. She might even know three. Definitely not four though.

Hy’Rell is here to Voyage and pretty much nothing else. But when has that ever stopped someone from going after a crew? She WILL Voyage for you, and in the spirit of the preservation of knowledge, will likely do so for quite some time.
