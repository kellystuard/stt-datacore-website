It's rarely clearer than in a case like this where one can definitively say that a crew has peaked. Georgie will never recapture the Voyage power that once upon a time offset her Skill set, Discovery Mega Events do not happen as frequently, and she has no more untapped Traits for future Collections. That being said, she's still viable as a Collection target and occasional thaw. Georgiou chugs along with a modest Event clip while Inspiring and Diplomat have at least some amount of Event potential moving forward.
