This laughing Vulcan and his dog are having a chuckle at how many pies he's stuck his fingers into.  Tuvok Shakur, as he is affectionately known, has found himself passed by in terms of daily use with the exception of clearing nodes in Fleet Boss Battles due to his myriad of Traits.  These Traits have also given him lasting game value with four stat-boosting Collections, plus the off chance of one to two more in the recent future.  Very new players may find use for him in Gauntlet, and his ship ability does include a hunk of Crit Bonus, so heâ€™s still an appetizing choice in Beholds.
