Looking like a middle school chem teacher still haunted by her student loans, is Vadic indeed sapped of her once-held passion or is there viability for your roster?

Let’s beeline to Voyages where her skill set buoys mid-level power to present a reasonable usage profile. SEC/ENG/SCI is not a permutation that sees frequent additions and you may even have a few years-old former top thirty names puttering around on your active squad like Tac Stamets or Bad Dad Leucon. While Vadic’s proficiencies are quite thin, that plum skill set meets an even sweeter trait set to make her a possible Goyage flier in the short-to-medium term.

Eight of those nine aforementioned traits are either collections or in the right size range to become collections. While her current rating there is nothing to write home about, that tally will certainly grow and perhaps in bunches, leaving her a fine crew to either cite up while her Voyage utility abides or add stars to passively to eventually reap a bushel of future collections.
