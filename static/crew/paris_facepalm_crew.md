From across the moor, Stars’ voice reverberates, “Who is this for(head)??”

An unnamed Tilting Point employee wanted to have some fun (shame on them), so this Paris was birthed, but he doesn’t really have a reason for being. Middling collection value is generally enough motivation for most Timelines players to throw on some pants and tap for a couple hours on the weekend, but it’s reasonable to want more from our new crew.

As approximately the billionth ENG primary Super Rare to come from events recently, Paris’ ENG-led skill set will somewhat go to waste on rosters that could use it the most. And while we championed Paris’ Faction-heavy event history in the early years of the game, his variant hit rate has cooled a bit since then and this particular card’s supporting traits have been more miss than hit. There are some perks here to be sure, but this is also a fairly unremarkable crew whose memorability will be carried on the wings of memes.
