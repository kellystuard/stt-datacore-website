Uhura, You-hura - step aside, there's a new variant in town, and her name is Woo-hura, if you'll pardon the Ric Flair-ism. This much requested (by me) variant from SNW's second episode debuts swinging for the fences with top flight voyage power, a plus skill set, four collections, and truly resplendent art. Even for those of us who have long since immortalised our Adiras Tal, our Racquetball O'Briens, or Ishan Chaye Siskos will have space in our hearts and voyages for DIP/ENG this hench, and while the skill set isn't exactly obscure, it does at least break up the glut of CDS Uhuras. 

It's also worth noting that EV Uhura debuts almost simultaneously with Technician Uhura, the DIP/ENG Honor Hall big base crew, and it can be categorically confirmed that yes, just like Hemmer, the better crew went into the six pack - not only does this actually voyage capable variant not cost 100k Honor, but she'll eventually join the portal and end up retrieveable or pullable from packs, unlike Technician, who has to be cited, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. The ancillary benefits aren't quite there, especially with only one more possible collection to be found in her traits outside of the moon logic of a Strange New Worlds collection and negligble Gauntlet or ship use, so don't go chasing waterfalls or diving into six packs unless you're primarily a voyager. But if you are, hey, happy diving. 

Just remember, BigBook.app does not recommend six packs and is not legally held culpable for any side effects that may ensue from pulling them, including nausea, screaming, crying, credit card overuse, or embarrassing videos of multiple pulls giving you every other card in the pack.
