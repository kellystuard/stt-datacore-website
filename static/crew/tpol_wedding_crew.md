T'Pol has come back to earth following a stellar debut in early 2018. Her Voyage ability is gone and her thin Trait set doesn't hold her in good stead with WRG's Collection push.

She still offers a few reasonable new player attributes including some fast Evasion on Ships if you Fuse her and Gauntlet rolls if you don't. Despite her poor Gauntlet Skill set and low 2nd/3rd rolls, T'Pol still owns the top Super Rarer DIP roll and can help young rosters get a foothold in that area until the Exclusives start to trickle in. With Bases unlikely to merit a thaw and poor Collection potential, this T'Pol is more of a new player card than one that will age gracefully alongside your roster.
