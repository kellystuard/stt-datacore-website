Objectively one of the crew in the game wearing red dresses, do not choose this Vash rashly from Super Rare Beholds. A solid DIP Base for Shuttles when she gets the rare call to action on the weekend, Picardâ€™s paramore is a zero on Collections as it stands but has three to four viable Traits waiting to pay off if you spend the resources to Immortalize this crew.
