Travis Mayweather fans rejoice...all 3 of you! Direct from the episode that gives us his famous and evergreen in-game quote - “Mayweather!” - comes the first new Travis representation in nearly three years.

If you are a new player with a need for someone in Arena, and you happen to use a ship with a Position Trigger like the Borg Sphere, then you may get some longer life out of the good Ensign than he had in the episode – he’s a 350% unlimited boomstick.

Now, for the post-mortem:

Not a particularly strong Voyager, this Super Rare will find use for most players in early game stages, where his Voyage use is OK at best featuring six Antimatter Trait matches. Beyond that, minimal Event possibilities and, at launch, two Collections, puts Travis where he is most known and comfortable – in the freezer.

Maybe the next Travis card will be better. We’ll meet again to evaluate that in two years when he is dragged out of obscurity and ready for Dr Phlox to perform its autopsy.
