TP/HG, no!
“You are too late, AGIMUS reigns!”

We’re sorry, everyone. We rushed to stop them, but we must have taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque. He’s just too good. This kind of power, in an Event reward? It’s going to be a bloodbath. Victorious Combs will be hopping on Voyages faster than he can take over Plymeria thank to a best-in-class DIP/ENG pairing that doesn’t need any help from a gullible Boimler to get going. With seven of his eight traits providing AM Bonus, he’ll be a mainstay for everyone who earns that first copy, be it from Event Rank, Event Packs (you may want to dip into your Dil for these if you don’t get him sooner) or a future BeGold once he hits Portal. 


This cite-on-sight sentient computer also offers four Stat-Boosting Collections, and a little drone told us to keep our eye out for the Jeffrey Combs Collection in the recent future. Come to think of it, the voice of that drone sounded awfully familiar…ok we may have to edit this out later to not look stupid. Even if that intel turns out to be false, it is still true that his DIP base will carry its weight on Faction Shuttles when the time comes. Not that you really need that much Diplomacy skill to convince a scholar such as myself that this is a great crew, mind you, but then…wait, did you trick me? Are you locking me up in the bowels of the BB Institute alongside past writers and replacing me with ChatGPT? You'll regret this! I will conquer this lab, and then I will take over the Big Book!
