It’s hard to recommend Cadet Voyage ability too strongly when they’re so easily outclassed by higher Rarity options, but when it comes attached to an otherwise versatile Crew - saddle up!

Stellar Voyage metrics, a big Rare DIP Base, and four fat Collections is exactly the kind of bite-sized Cadet Lunchables that will satisfy even a veteran player’s hunger. Pour one out for his lack of weekend Cadet eligibility; if he had nonhuman DNA and the right chromosomes, he might be the best Rare Crew in the game.
