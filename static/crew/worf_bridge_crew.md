The portmanteau Borf is kind of funny, but Bridge Wof is more headache than humorous. The Timelines team, once again showing they don’t play their own game or understand any semblance of balance, have printed a second consecutive SEC/ENG gauntlet exclusive (third if you could EV Suit Gorn) with an unprecedented number of 65% gauntlet crit sets; nine so far. 

Borf is a microcosm of design failure. No Gauntlet crew ranked above him has unique proficiency quipment like Worf’s Sword of Kahless and In his best gauntlet, he owns *seven* top seven gauntlet pairs, four of which include a skill he doesn’t own. There are more 65% Borf gauntlets each year than shark attacks on humans worldwide.

But that’s not your problem anymore once he drops for you in the gauntlet, right? Despite his overall dominance, Borf carries a lot of overlap with the previously referenced EV Suit Gorn and Omet'iklan along with previous Gauntlet exclusive Tribbled Koloth and Korax. As that stable of SEC crew rotate through their oppressive crit gauntlets, you’ll want to utilize all of them from time to time so Worf may rotate out for a breather a bit more often than other top Gauntlet names.

The Timelines team have their Gauntlet cookie cutter mold firmly set and this crew is no exception; a worthwhile trait set for lots of collections and event bonuses, but awful base and voyage numbers. Like TKK, Borf also has an intriguing shipboard ability, but isn’t even the best +10 attack, crit bonus-boosting, 38% uptime, eight second initializing crew named Worf so his contributions there look better on paper than in practice.

Bridge Worf is far and away his best Legendary variant, though we may see more down the line as Michael Dorn’s performance as the honorable Klingon straight man continues to grow in status to rival Trek icons like Kirk and Spock.
