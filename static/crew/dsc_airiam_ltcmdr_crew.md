Outside of Discovery Mega Events (we keep saying theyâ€™re probably dead, then we get another one), Airiam is living Trait to Trait on the weekends, where her value has taken a big dip. Voyages and Gauntlet are out of the question too given her age, leaving a fast-Activating Arena Attack Boost as her only significant avenue for daily contributions and even then, only for a short time. In the meantime, Collections have become the name of the game and all but one of her viable Traits have been called to duty. For Collection value alone, feel free to Fuse up and Freeze Airaim at your leisure and wait for scattershot Event Bonuses to spring her from Cryostasis jail.
