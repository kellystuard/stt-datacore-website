We waited years for a good Scotty and he was delivered in the form of this ENG/SEC/CMD powerhouse, and then WRG power crept him into oblivion. Now, he should be hauled away AS GARBAGE!

If that’s being too harsh, you’re probably right. The former holder of the Shepherd Trait (RIP), Scotty is one of the gatekeepers to the Tribbled Collection, so unless you want to Immortalize some pretty bad crew, consider him from Beholds and wait for him to snap up a third Collection one day. Outside of his strong ENG base for Scotty and Trait-based Events, he has a slow but useful 25% Hull Repair Ship Ability for Fleet Boss Battles, so he’ll bridge the gap until you can retrieve his betters.
