Don’t you love it when a ubiquitous god zaps you from your current reality, takes you back to the past and lets you re-live the happiest moment of your life?

….your happiest moment was being stabbed in the back by a Nausicaan?

Doesn’t sound like something you’d smile or laugh at. But if you do, then this is (half) the card for you! The Nausicaan Thug, who has been on the shelf from being released for over 5 years now, has finally made his in-game debut!  And boy, did they leave his 5 year old stats intact!

Sure, his SEC Base is high, maybe Nightmare Mode enjoyers will find a Voyage seat or Shuttle seat for him. Sure, he is armed and dangerous with two Collections at launch, and the probability of several more a few lifetimes from now. Beyond those, it’s a card from a scene that is very memorable, but we’ll never get the full release of the other half.  For that injustice alone, you should send this thug to the deep freeze.
