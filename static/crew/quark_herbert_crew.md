In this house, we love and respect Armin Shimmerman - especially when this particularly Principal Synder-esque variant nets a fistful of Collections and Quark events with a thaw-able CMD Base to boot. He'd almost be useful on Ships, too, if not for a pesky Attack handicap, but he offers enough value otherwise for a 2-Skill Super Rare. If Crew can't bring it in the daily use department, then they can only hope to offer post-Fusion value like this. Acquire, you lobeless fool!
