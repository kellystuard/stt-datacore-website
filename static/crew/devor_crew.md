Devor…you mean the Devore Imperium? You mean we’re getting PRAX‽ Oh, it’s TNG Tuvok. Well, that’s cool too.

A less common bit of value comes to Not-vok in the form of position-triggered shipboard damage. A hefty 350% boom comes online early enough to be relevant in the Captain Division of arena and its lack of a limit makes him a possible, if slow cycling option in Fleet Boss Battles too.

The rest of this crew is murkier, however. A reasonable voyage power level for a Super Rare debut is rendered mute thanks to an awful skill set. And his lineup of mostly relevant traits haven’t provided this non-Tuvok crew much in the way of event bonuses while also not yet blooming into actual collection value, though that’s likely to change for the better in the future.
