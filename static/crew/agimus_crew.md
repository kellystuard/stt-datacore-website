The Age of Animated Voyagers continues. With the love being spread between TAS and Lower Decks, WRG is on a spree that shows no signs of stopping soon. The latest entry in the always welcome ENG Primary Club has the distinction of not having been introduced  in a Tuesday Pack (don’t do Tuesday Packs, kids), and it gets better from there. Befitting of the inimitable Jeffrey Combs, AGIMUS stands above his peers thanks to Skill Order, Raw Power, and Traits. 

A Cite-on-Sight character for anyone who spent the time tapping away to earn at least one copy, he’ll be a mainstay on your Voyages for years to come. Pair that with a strong ENG Base and “Lord” AGIMUS should see plenty of use on Event Shuttles as well if he’s not too busy trying to assemble another fleet of murder drones. His 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability isn’t as shiny as it may seem at first glance as there are plenty of faster and Trigger-free candidates out there, but we can’t let this Self-Aware Megalomaniacal Computer get too powerful, can we?
