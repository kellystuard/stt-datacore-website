Y’all have been waiting for more additions to your YMCA bridge crew, here you go! ‘Hands up’ means SEC primary in the 20th century; the time period where the Displaced Taylor comes from and has lived in her entire life…

Slowly aging out of Voyages, as gracefully as Catherine Hicks has, Taylor still has a little gas in the tank from her plus Skill set and Antimatter seats. No longer an instant Citation candidate, she might still find some use on the early game roster in that game mode.

There’s painfully few toppings on this thin crust pie otherwise - her Collection profile is meh, her Event chances are slim, and there just isn’t enough Proficiency power to put her excellent Skill set to use in the Gauntlet.
