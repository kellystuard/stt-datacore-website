Niners Kira is a Marty McFly (ball) special - you may not be ready for her, but your kids are gonna love her. Falling out of daily use contention long ago due to age, Kira chips in with a rock-steady event history and crazy event ceiling. How many collections can she squeeze from four traits? Six? Seven? She's an obligatory name for veteran players to acquire, though it's understandable if new players would like to skip collecting another CMD/DIP/SEC crew who wonâ€™t pay dividends early on.
