Some people just have “it”. And oh Mama, Santiago Cabrera has “it”. Rakish art, with belt buckle askew, might lull you into thinking more of Rios than what this card offers. But before we wake up, let’s wax lyrical about his Traits.

A handful of Mega Events and standalone Events derived solely from Traits is your best bet for use here and his Skills will receive favorable Shuttle seating to bump him up the thaw list on certain weekends. Traits have also landed him spots in a few Collections with a couple other likely bullets left in his Collection six-shooter.

That being said, this is not a crew you should be using very often without the frost still on his jacket from being pulled out of Cryostasis. Flat power levels in most areas and a few notable drawbacks like Voyage Skill set or short Ship Ability Duration blunt his usefulness in the early game and relegate him to an asset whose value unlocks after Immortalization. Now if we could only get that shirtless Cristóbal variant…
