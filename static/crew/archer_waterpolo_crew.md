The most Bakula looking art ever, this card is far more effective than the vast majority of Archer’s pickup lines. Setting him apart from the rash of voyage/base options is his six collection debut, which remains a rarity even as we pass fifty collections in game. He should remain a retrieval option in the coming years, even as his daily effectiveness wanes.

But we’re not there yet. His mid-level voyage debut power isn’t to be dismissed with TP putting the freeze on CMD/SEC/SCI skill sets of late. Most of the names above him in the voyage ranks were printed multiple years ago and lack his event or collection prowess, his unique quipment, or all of the above. Archer’s character has rebounded from an early erasure by Disruptor Beam and now gets events on the regular to round out his profile and give him multiple areas of contribution for your active roster.
