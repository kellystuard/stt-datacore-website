The Viceroy is among the strongest Voyagers in his Rarity and that alone makes him worthy of the resources to Immortalize in the early game. Look for him to contribute in daily use until youâ€™ve moved on to higher Rarities, and enjoy the early notch on the Romulan Collection to give you a global Stat boost.
