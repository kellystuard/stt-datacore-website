It’s a bit odd to see such a highly rated debut without an elite stat, but McCoy exceeds the sum of his parts. CMD/MED is the easy headline here and if translated to Legendary status, TP could have definitely sold some packs on the back of that alone. At the Super Rare level, it amounts to an early game voyager who efficacy surpasses the raw power levels thanks to that fortuitous skill set and strong antimatter hit rate.

Owning a high floor/low ceiling event tally, this McCoy has been very consistent in terms of compiling weekend bonuses and when paired with a worthy CMD base, he should be costing players merits for thaws on the regular. 

A trigger-gated ship ability is easy to dismiss, but +10 attack at the Super Rare level can be deadly for players climbing the Arena ladder or in FBB progression and should make him a consideration for many players in the early game. With a handful of collections already realized, there’s something for everyone here and makes McCoy an automatic get as an event reward or even once he enters the portal.
