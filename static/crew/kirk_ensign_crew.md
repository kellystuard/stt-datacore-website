Did anyone think the first crew we would see in TOS-era Starfleet Academy Cadet uniform would be Ensign Kirk and not the illusory Finnegan from “Shore Leave”? Well, not me! I didn’t!

Introduced during the Timelines’ Originals Mega Event, this Super Rare variant of Jimothy Kirk before he was James T. Kirk has upper echelon power on Voyages if you Fully Fused him early on in your Timelines “career”, along with a stopgap Ship Ability for Skirmish and Arena loadouts. Kirk makes good use of his thin Trait list to achieve four Collections, and Kirk Events are plentiful, but perhaps won’t make use of his off-the-beaten-path SCI Primary.
