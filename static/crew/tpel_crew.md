Alas, poor Tuvok. So far from home that missing your loved ones is illogical even for a Vulcan, this is nonetheless exactly how he felt about his wife. To the point where even a hologram version of her was “adequate, but no substitute”, I’ve gotta wonder just what this woman has to offer.

As it turns out, a lot. You the Player may want to lust after her the same way Tuvok did. For starters, her ears are the correct length. If that alone doesn’t scratch your itch, T’Pel is also quite the Voyager. Bloated though DIP/CMD may be, that Trait set will ensure top billing on your Voyages for far more than the recent future. With variety like this, you can expect some Eventing potential in addition to Collection work. How does five Stat-Boosting ones with up to four more sound?

Good enough? Artistic licence my Vulcan ass…
