It’s hard to turn away a Kirk at any Rarity, but this one doesn’t have a ton to offer. A thin Trait list that is not likely to offer more than two to three Collections and a difficult build full of Faction Items makes him unappetizing as a Behold choice, but if you do take him and don’t have a lot of Arena or Skirmish options, his chunk of Crit Bonus as an Ardra-lite may help you in the early game. Bases are just good enough to thaw for a Kirk Faction Event, if you are making a deep run.
