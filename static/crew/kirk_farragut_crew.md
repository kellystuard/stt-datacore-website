Wanted: New actor to play legendary role from iconic television series. Nerd backlash will be strong. Facial expressions and long verbal pauses a must. Will receive Super-Rare card in aging franchise mobile game. Card will not have collections or be for sale. Non-negotiable. If interested, buy one Elusive Treasure pack. No cash value. Not redeemable in Delaware or Iowa.  

Fresh from the vault of unreleased crew, WRG saw fit to accidentally not put Farragut Kirk and Admiral Pike in an Elusive Treasures pack. After fleecing the community of tens of Dilithium, the rewards blessed accounts like the rains in Africa, giving those who pulled just one 650 DIL pull a copy. And oh boy what a value!

No, really!  

Ok, maybe not so much.

Surely we can find *some* value in Paul Wesley’s first card, right?

Well, he’s got....zero collections.  He’s not terribly useful in Arena.  The most voyage use the new Kirk will see is for Nightmare Mode™ enjoyers, who probably didn’t have 650 spare Dilithium to ‘earn’ a copy.

So...in the immortal words of StarsAndGarters...”WHO IS THIS CARD FOR?”

I don’t know.
