Can’t win for losin’. Even with a post-release buff bringing the third Continuum Mission exclusive crew Kejal up to playable levels, the same server release also buffed Wizard Hemmer, who shares her SCI/DIP/ENG skill order, above her on voyages. In truth, that skill set has become fairly bloated with new releases aplenty including campaign, mega, honor hall, and event options, making it one of the easiest skill pairings to stock up on.
 
Kejal’s position triggered ship ability looks snappy at only a fourteen second cycle, but if that were particularly relevant for FBB, there have been other identical options floating around for years. Middling in most respects for a new release, though with admittedly broad utility, Kejal ends up as a nice bonus for players who routinely clear Continuum Missions each week rather than someone to break the bank for.
