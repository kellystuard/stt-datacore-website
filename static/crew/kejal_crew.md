Despite Continuum Missions being nothing more than away missions lifted one-for-one from previous developers’ work and launched in a hilariously disastrous manner resulting in an easily exploitable bug that players gamed for an entire week to the tune of a hundred thousand dilithium and/or quantum, the exclusive cards that come from CM have already established a more impressive lineage than The Dishonor Hall (look how they massacred my boy).

Ubiquitous Borg Queen - wow, a tier 1 crew right off the bat! Impressive art with more impressive stats.
EV Suit Gorn - a collaborative community effort to make an awesome gauntleteer with great collections.
Kejal - a miserable, vomitous mass wallowing in freakish misery forever.

We didn’t even bother writing this note when we first saw the stats, thinking ‘there’s no way this makes it live, right?’ The last crew to be released rated this lowly, Indomitable Pike, indeed had a statistical glow-up before release and he wasn’t even debuting as an exclusive drop that you can’t buy your way to without the requisite fused crew. 

By the numbers, this really isn’t the worst thing since you ran into your boss at the beach and had to maintain eye contact (who brings their kids *and* wears a speedo?). But Kejal is clearly below the average of a new release in nearly every attribute, offering nothing that can’t be obtained easily elsewhere. If you’re a completionist who intends on finishing CM weekly regardless of the carrot, Kejal at least has middling collection value and should snag a weekend shuttle seat once or twice per year due to the lack of SCI options among some of her traits.
