You will find M’Benga fly-fishing in this lovely art, and thankfully you need not fish for him in a Tuesday Pack, as he debuts in a charming Skirmish/Galaxy Hybrid Event. Since it’s clear we may never get “Fishing Jake and Ben Sisko” from “Emissary”, this will have to do. 

M’Benga has a solid set of Traits for a Super Rare, which is really all anybody wants from a crew of that Rarity. Four debut Collections tap out his entire Trait list, but four is really enough when you also consider his nice Ship Ability, which is a big chunk of Crit Bonus to the tune of +12,000 with a nice Accuracy boost, notedly without a handicap to Evasion or Attack. It’s a little shy of longtime stalwart Ardra, but he lasts longer, cycles faster, increases Accuracy higher, and has no use Limit.
