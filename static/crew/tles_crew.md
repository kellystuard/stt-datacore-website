In the eyes of T’Pol’s mum here, T’Les is more when it comes to human companions. She was no match for Tucker’s loveable demeanour however, as he finally won her over with his Florida Man charms. Will her in-game stats be able to win YOU over, or should they be bombarded with photonics by the Vulcan High Command? In the spirit of the Vulcan Reformation, let’s argue for both.

Pro: Her SCI/DIP/CMD voyage ability is pretty solid for a Super Rare crew. She’ll get some use for younger and Nightmare Mode™ players.

Con: She’s only a Super Rare, so even if you find yourself using her early on, she’s destined for the freezer.

Pro: Traits that bring four Stat-Boosting Collections and maybe a shot at two more. Plus hey, Casual+Vulcan, there aren’t many of those! Could be useful for Fleet Boss Battle nodes.

Con: We’re in the golden era of Collections, so having four wouldn’t even elicit an eyebrow raise out of a stoic Vulcan.

Pro: Um…free copies if you’re playing her debut Event?

And that’s really it folks. Nothing too special, nothing to scoff at either. The Plomeek Soup of crew.
