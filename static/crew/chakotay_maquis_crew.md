Maquis Chakotay is well-known for needing so many Faction items you will want to send him out the airlock by the time you get him Fully Equipped. Eventually he pays you off with his Traits, including possible esoteric inclusions such as Maquis and Smuggler (what exactly were the Maquis smuggling anyways, WRG?).
