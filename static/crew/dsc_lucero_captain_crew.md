Thinking Lucero would anchor our Discovery Mega Event Shuttles for years...well, I guess that makes us the idiots. At least almost every other part of this card is good for something. Ardra-lite Ship Ability, worthwhile Voyage metrics for the early game player, even an admirable Event tally post-Discovery Mega Events.

Rather than sit on her hands with a score of untapped Traits, Lucero cashed in early and offers us strong Collection value right out of the box. Established rosters welcome her aboard for that reason alone, while early-to-midgame players can utilize her other perks safe in knowing that the Behold investment will pay off long term as well.
