“I am not a computer nerd. I prefer to be called a hacker!” - Tilly, probably. Unfortunately, 900+ years of improved database security appears to have gotten the best of her until Vance Vance Revolution shows up. Shame he wasn’t able to stop her on time…

In a world where Demo Man Scotty is light years ahead of the competition for ENG Base supremacy, Tilly offers a healthy option amongst the also-rans. Seats for this skill may be limited, but you can expect her to do some reliable work in a Faction Event should one of her traits get the assignment (she seems to be a magnet for Mega events, even the non-Discovery themed ones), especially if you’re running more than the core four Shuttles at a time. A +15000 to Crit Bonus is once again overshadowed by Demo Man, both in terms of Initiation Time and total bonus. Ouch. But you know what Demo Man can’t do? Voyage! That’s right, in possession of not only 3 skills (take that, Scotty!), but a rather respectable SEC score in her Secondary spot, Caffeinated Tilly is one of the best ENG primary Voyagers out there. So, while not necessarily someone to go out of your way to rank for unless you love the character or are pushing for the following Event, this is definitely someone to keep your eye on to see how they’ve aged once they hit the Portal.
