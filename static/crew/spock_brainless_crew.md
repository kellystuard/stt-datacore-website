Brain and Brain! What is Brain‽ They couldn’t have made this a Legendary variant, right? But Spocko at a fraction of his power is still worth a pop or two.

Traity as ever, Brainless is a no-brainer Collection choice, both immediately and long term. If you end up leveling him early on, you’ll appreciate his Cadet Mission coverage four days a week. With the Exobiology Trait liberally sprinkled throughout those SCI Nodes, he’ll be able to cover both his Skills effectively. You might opt to level female Uncommon crew first for better Cadet Mission coverage, but Spock is still worth more than the laughable reputation conferred on him by his episode might imply.
