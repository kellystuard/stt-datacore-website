Rudy's on a vacation far away
Beam aboard and talk it over
So many corpses along the way
You know Seven keeps givin' me the cold shoulder

I just want the shields to hold tonight
I don't want to kill more slugs tonight

We ain't got any dilithium to lose
And no chance to refill it later
I guess it's time to combine the crews
Bring me my synaptic stimulator

I just want the shields to hold tonight
I don't want to kill more slugs tonight

Try to stop Max Burke from takin'
Over while my ship is breakin' up
It's been a while since I was all alone
But now it is my chance to atone

As you're leaving, promise you'll get them home
I won't forget what you told me
I guess you're right and I was wrong
So now I'm where I belong

I just hope the shields hold tonight
I don't want to kill more slugs tonight
I just hope the shields hold tonight
I don't want to kill more slugs tonight
