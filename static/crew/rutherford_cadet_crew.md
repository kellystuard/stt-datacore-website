Rutherford wasn’t always a goody-two-shoes and this is his pre-implant version. A middle of the road Super Rare on debut, he’s got decent Voyage power for his rarity and an attractive Skill set to boot. A strong SEC Base will allow him to participate on the weekends when his name is called for a variant Event or one of his Traits hits a bonus. If you’re in need for help on Ships, Ruthie has a chunk of Crit Bonus plus an Attack Boost. Look for him to top out at four or five Collections, making him a decent investment.
