Wesley might be Salia-vating over this shapeshifting Daledian but like her treacherous attendant we are not as impressed with her swooning over you solids, wait which shape shifting race was this again?

No longer a Voyage option, the limitations of Saliaâ€™s Trait set have begun to show and you can see a pretty bare Event and Collection future for her moving forward. This is a card to take stars on only when your other Behold options are a disappointment. Now shut up kid, I want to hear Riker tell me more about my eyes.
