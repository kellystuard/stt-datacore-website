Clearly bowing to pressure from Timelines Talks, noted #1 premium, exclusive stream for all things Star Trek: Timelines, Ryn the Andorian is the kind of card that makes players sigh in envy and wallets scream in dread. Starting from the top, the art - instantly memeable, but also unique among the recent spate of artwork for definitely not being a promotional picture trace, giving it a flavor that the beautiful but sterile art a lot of crew get these days are sorely missing. Pose him next to a displeased Killy or another pointing crew for instant hilarity. WRG made sure to stack the deck in favor of Ryn on almost every field.

The Trait list is Tier 1 all on its own, brimming with Collections ranging from the massive to the elusive, and multiple additional viable Traits for later. Reams of HFS crew are looking at this guy's Antimatter coverage with envy - while other blandly-Traited Voyagers scrabbling over the same few seats, Ryn can stroll right in and sit himself down wherever he wants almost without competition. 

While Ryn is unlikely to stack up as many variants as fan favorites Garak or Dukat, his Event prospects are still rosy - even playing down the past-its-sell-by date Discovery hidden tag, he's stumbled into four Trait Mega Events and will likely stumble into even more. Even without bonus, he can hold down Shuttles for Factions with anemic ENG coverage.
