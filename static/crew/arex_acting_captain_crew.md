Aaaaaaand they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming - little known fact, Smash Mouth's 1999 hit was actually written by Greg Camp in a precognitive fugue state where he predicted WRG's production of “Later Losers” Voyage Crew in Q2/3 of 2022. A strange choice for their second album, but hey, it seems to have aged well - as will Arex, the true Voyage all-star. Even with WRG's printing presses stuck on ULTRA-TURBO-MEGA-HYPEBEAST, Arex is going to last you for the rest of the game on Voyages, and comes bearing a hat trick of tricky, wide Collections with Traits to spare.

He even comes locked and loaded with decent enough Proficiencies that you could use him in a pinch in Gauntlet if you feel like flipping all three fingers to your opponent when their 5% Astrophysicist Sulu completely whups you out of nowhere. The esoteric Traits and meaty CMD Base mean he won't be a complete Event non-entity, but this is first and foremost a Voyager, so get out there, grab a copy of this Edosian, and make your Voyages E-go-go-gosian. Oh, and give Courier Burnham her notice on the way out, would you?
