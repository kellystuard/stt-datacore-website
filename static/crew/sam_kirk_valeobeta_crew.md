“I bet it's real creepy here after dark.” Tell that to your moustache, Sam.

Who are we kidding, it’s glorious. Sam Kirk is a treasure and nothing is ever allowed to happen to him (flying pain pancakes aside).

Windlowless Van Owner Sam joins us at the heels of the apparent “Valeo Beta V”-aissance. “Only” a Super Rare Crew, he will still nonetheless find use on younger (or sophisticated Nightmare Mode™ enjoyer) rosters thanks to a decent SEC Base, perfect for early-game Shuttle work, and occasional Voyage use. This is unfortunately all the help he’s going to be giving you though, as without any Gauntlet or Ship Battle use to speak of, not to mention a rather dire trait list Collection-wise, he is destined for the freezer. Kind of fitting, given the planet he’s currently on…
