Data Vee is so much like many of his variant Legendary brothers from that era of the game - a zero on Voyages by now, solid Event work, and a fistful of Collections and Fleet Boss Battle Combo Node solving prowess from his Trait list. Warming his hands with the delightful developer choice that this variant, of all the Datae, got to go into Holodeck Enthusiasts, he also unlocks three additional Collections and has room for two more.
