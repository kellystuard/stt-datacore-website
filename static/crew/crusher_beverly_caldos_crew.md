Ghost ****er Bev (GFC), meme-adjacent though she may be, has managed to avoid the in-game point-and-laugh that names like Grebnedlog or Linus received. One of the most legendary scientists in the known universe gettin’ freaky with a candle...who'da thunk?

Her heady SCI Base should find plenty of Faction Event work and though Crusher herself is a less-than-frequent Event name, when her name is called, or her Traits are tapped, she’ll ride a Shuttle with the best. 

Her limited Trait list is also about to lock her out of a 100% chance in Crew Retrieval, so if you really want her, grab copies now before the next Time Portal Update.
