Remember Quark’s? It’s back. In franchise form. That right, always a man with the lobes for opportunity, Quark has expanded Quark's Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade to 21 locations (and counting) across the galaxy!

In true Ferengi fashion, Uncle Quark has made sure to dip his fingers into as many Event pies as possible, spreading traits around so that there’s something there for everyone. Those traits also bring five Collections to the family feedbag, with plenty of opportunity for new franchise openings in up to four more! There’s even some voyage utility there, especially if you aren’t the kind of player to spend money on the ÜberKampaign track (which offers the mighty King Mudd the First and his identical skill order). Unlike Mudd, they’re practically giving him away! Actually, they are literally giving him away. 

“Wait, what? I didn’t authorize this! Does my brother know what you’re trying to pull? I have rights you know! Rights to profit!” Okay, easy Quark. During your month-long Objective Event players will have to earn additional copies by spending resources. And to truly get your value, will even have to spend a Cite to Immortalize you. It’s called a business strategy.

“Ah well then. Step right up and get a selfie or autograph with me, the hero of the Dominion War! First one’s on TP (limit one per customer, not valid in Karemma territory, some conditions may apply).”
