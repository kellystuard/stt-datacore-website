Pup-card's numbers aren't quite as eye-popping as on release, but remain excellent. His huge SCI Base won't only claim regular Shuttle work, it also puts to shame global gift Mambo and Campaign freebie Irumodic for variant Event work which has been just above average to date and fairly reliable.

His Voyage power is aging like Sir Patrick, but still can pitch in on the average roster if you have him Fully Fused from his Mega Event.

In the running for best Mega Event Recurring Legendary to date and batting ðŸ’¯ in a handful of areas, don't feel on the back foot if you've come to Picard and I-Chaya some time later, just choose from Beholds and enjoy.
