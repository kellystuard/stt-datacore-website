Down low, too slow! Haha just kidding, I’m only *acting*. When a card gets stamped with “Best retrieval chance will be only 50%” from the moment they debut, there’s nowhere to go but down. A lack of trait complexity, which drives every corner of the game, is a death knell for crew. Even Carey’s art proclaims ‘ordinary’. An engineering primary would seem to imply some sort of usage, perhaps for newer players, but as the fifth such Super Rare obtainable in events over the last couple months, this Average Joe is merely a perfunctory collection notch or three.
