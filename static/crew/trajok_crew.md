Green light voyage and shuttle scores are generally a dime a dozen, but despite his lower tier, Trajok can fill a few gaps for players across the spectrum. Vets, and frankly everybody, should want this easy event reward pickup for his collection five-pack. Short of a Deep Space Nine collection, which may be inevitable should the game survive that long, he’s maxed out. Between that sad news and his lack of event work, he’s a true freeze and forget.

Although for newer rosters, MED/SEC is an unusual enough combination that he should earn his active roster spot for a while. Which is excellent, because who wouldn’t want to see that art as often as possible?
