If you are coming here to decide which of the 3 Uncommon Crew (Sisko, Kirk, Picard) to choose from your Uncommon Behold (the only one ever!), you may want to select Promoted Sisko. He’s one of the top Uncommon Voyagers, and is Traited like almost every other Sisko - nicely! Follow those Traits to four non-Rarity Collections and room for up to two more, filling out Ben’s six pack.
