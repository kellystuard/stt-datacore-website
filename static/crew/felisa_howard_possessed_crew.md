Nana Howard, noted herbalist and erotic non-fiction author, was a contemporary of the 21st century Human writer E. L. James [citation needed]. This influence can be best found in her groundbreaking memoirs, published posthumously after being discovered by her granddaughter Beverley Crusher following her death in 2370. Scholars agree that they were “particularly erotic” and make the reader feel as if they are really experiencing the characters.

The same critics are less favourable when it comes to discussing her Star Trek Timelines career. Her debut here does not have nearly the same impact as her aforementioned seminal literary work, being a Super Rare character without notable Gauntlet viability or even short-term Voyage use. Ronin, and any players reading this, can at least take solace in her Collection value/future potential, as she’s simply destined for the cryo candle - er i mean, freezer - immediately upon completion.
