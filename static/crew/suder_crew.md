Suder doesn’t belong on any active rosters, but if you’re looking for a reason to snag a great on-screen character, pray to the Circle of Traits which seeks to bring all crew to relevance in time. 

His six non-HFS Traits are all varying levels of reasonableness when it comes to Collection potential and indeed he has a higher ceiling there than most, though it remains to be seen if WRG goes the direction of additional Troi-heavy Collections beyond Betazoid, or Vulcan-adjacent Telepath one. With bad Bases that would take many requisition Shuttles to find a spot even with a bonus, Suder is a Collections-or-bust dice roll in otherwise bad Beholds.
