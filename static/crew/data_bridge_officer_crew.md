Somehow, Data returned.

Yes, it’s Star Trek and no one is ever truly dead, and this Bridge Officer Data enjoys the spoils of his fresh resurrection with a refreshed power level on Voyages and Shuttles. While his Skill set and order do include the not-as-desirable stack of CMD/DIP to start, Data has an ENG kicker as a Tertiary to take some of the bad taste out of your mouth, and he’s got the requisite Voyage power to take the rest of it out with minty positronic freshness.

A solid Trait list allows Data to collect a septet of Voyage Antimatter bonuses, and has him dangling a possible ceiling of six Collections tantalizingly above the head of anyone who snagged him from his debut Pack or those who look to grab him sometime in 2024 with a Time Portal Update. Data and Trait-based Events will put the aforementioned top two Skills to work on Shuttles, and a Frantic McCoy-esque Ship Ability gives him a little more uniqueness for a “win with your favorites” Arena/Skirmish build.
