Any discussion of Dahj that doesn't involve her footwear choices or Kid Vid glasses has to start with her Trait list, which at this point in the game is the sole thing to pay attention to about a crew without viable Voyage power, Gauntlet prowess, or Ship Ability.

Already having cashed in both of her most likely Traits for Collections, Dahj is left with a few bloated options which are unlikely at best to provide more Collections or bonuses on the weekend. Without all but a slim possibility for other variants, her Event chances rely on her Trait list, which as mentioned is not rife with bonus options. If you come across her in a Behold, know you are getting a crew with slim value in the Event/Collection bonus era.
