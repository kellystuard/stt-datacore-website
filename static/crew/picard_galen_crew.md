Galen's daily use metrics are totally superfluous at this point. It's understandable given his age, but it's a similar story for Picard events too. Where he once shined as the best (only) SCI option for his character, Picard has been given several variants to flex his muscle, er, brain, including two former Mega Recurring Legendaries and one Time Portal giveaway/Object Event reward. Still worth a thaw situationally, Galen spends his time these days as a part time Event pilot and mid-level Collection piece.
