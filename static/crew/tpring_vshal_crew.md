Who doesn’t love that awkward dinner with your parents while your new fiance gets ruthlessly grilled and judged. Ah, Vulcan rituals. At least she stood by her man. 

You know how we like to promote those Nightmare Mode™ wackos. Well, here we go again. A strong CMD Shuttle and Voyage character for Legendary deficient rosters, you’ll want to take a copy when she hits the Portal. A close rival to Ardra for Arena battles, you can use T’Pring in her place with hardly any penalty, especially as a newer account. As for all other players, the lasting value lies in her Collection potential, with three Stat-Boosting ones to her name as of the addition of the Festive trait and up to four more in the future.
