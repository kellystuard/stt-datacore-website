We occasionally discuss the concept of 'empty calories' crew in this space and Tilly is certainly cake and soda for breakfast. Dahar Master Kor said it best, "Savor the fruit of life, my young friends. It has a sweet taste when it is fresh from the vine. But don't live too long. The taste turns bitter after a time."

Tillyâ€™s lack of Traits sabotage her utility, as they usually do. She has likely capped out at a pair of Collections, and really only variant or another resurrection of Discovery Mega Events will give her life on the weekends.

Even a CMD/ENG Gauntlet pair bereft of elevated Crit chances misses the boat for what could be niche utility thanks to that stack's lack of strong Gauntlet options and no walls to speak of.
