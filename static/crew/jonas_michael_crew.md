Lots of scorecard red lights for Mike, while his B I G B A S E and a tenner will get you a ham sandwich. Damn inflation. As an event reward, new accounts will get some use from an ENG primary offering they can fuse up, but for players considering Jonas as a behold prospect, thereâ€™s almost nothing notable here until more of his traits materialize into collection value.
