There's some intermittent Event usage here, but you're taking Martok because he's a one stop Collection shop. Veteran players will gobble him up at the Super Rare Behold screen as a cure for their Collection ills as his Trait list is all thriller, no filler. Unfortunately, the only other attribute of note is his trio of big bonus Event features - all having come in different Events. His Bases may be too poor to consider thawing if heâ€™s not a featured name.
