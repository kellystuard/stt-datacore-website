An extremely Faction-lite card to build, Sulu is a perfunctory midgame leveling “project” for players looking to finish the Common Collection.

Somehow one of the Traitiest Sulu variants, the Leftenant has a reasonable Collection ceiling, with up to two more left to pay off, but is functionally useless if you’re not playing “Nightmare Mode”.
