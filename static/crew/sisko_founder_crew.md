One might ponder how Commander Sisko would have fared in the era of the Enterprise. Perhaps Picard would skillfully navigate the political minefield, and Janeway, no doubt, would diplomatically offer coffee to the Tellerites to mollify their demands. Meanwhile, there's Ben "War Crimes as a Warning" Sisko, resorting to physical confrontation with the Andorian ambassador just to grab their attention.

As Sisko traverses the stat-boost wormhole in the collection belt, he assumes the role of the emissary to the players of Timelines, all eager to pay homage with citations aplenty. With six collections successfully completed, Sisko becomes an invaluable card, particularly in the realm of cite/retrieval options for the discerning collector. Only beaten by several Spocks, a Dukat and somehow, Rom.

However on the stats side, whilst he has numbers to make it on a voyage or two, his skill set demands that there will be better crew along the way, very soon. CDS being the most popular variation among Timelines crew and no doubt his numbers will be bested without noticing. Once his giveaway concludes, one shouldn't rush to retrieve him for enhancing voyages. However, for collections, prioritizing him is an absolute must.

Now, let's return to the festivities with champagne, jambalaya, andâ€”oh dear, Sisko has just executed another suplex on the Vulcan Ambassador.
