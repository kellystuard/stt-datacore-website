A misnomer, she can’t really fly. Wait, I mean she’s not really concerning! Green light debut metrics across the board for Janeway; top ten base, tops in her voyage triplet, five collections, and ample event work. Mega recurring crew occasionally pull more scrutiny in this space because of their availability and players’ dilemma about whether they should drop a cite to finish them, but it’s Andiamo! for Kathy. Although she lacks a particularly elite stat in any area, she’s worthwhile in several and so there’s nothing to be concerned about for this solidly above average mega offering.
