Boy, I sure do love Tuesday pack exclusives that are incremental variants of a normal crew. What’s that you say? You do as well? Beautiful! Because Bold Brad Boimler beams (a)board byour bcrew bquarters, and berated by BigBook.app!...(hey, I get paid by the B’s here).

In all seriousness, that joke will be more memorable than ol’ bold Brad here, as he is a typical ‘Freeze & Forget’ Super Rare card. Sure, he comes to the table with four Collections, and…uh, well…ok. So, his Ship Ability is from 2018 levels of usefulness, giving a 200% boom – which is meaningless compared to other Super Rare options like Vindicta Mariner. His Voyage abilities are basically categorized as ‘also ran’, because he’s the 5th option in his Skill triplet, to say nothing of his Bonus Trait matches that aren’t Bridge Crew worthy. I doubt even Nightmare Mode™ enjoyers would find much use here, as there is no special or Trait specific Quipment. If you ever run across him in Gauntlet, you know that Delta Shift has truly won.

Bad, Brad. Bad. Boy oh boy, Bold Boimler is blah.
