There's a smoking crater where Durango's Voyage power used to be, but as far as old school cards and Event/Collection combo platters go, Troi can still get it done.

The SEC skill doesn’t get an hourly refresh like DIP and so Troi’s Winchester is still of a respectable caliber and will allow her priority seating for a handful of Events each year. The flavorful episode she comes from affords Troi some luxury Traits beyond her normal ship’s business and should see her Collection count slowly tick upwards while helping to flesh out some more volatile Event counts from year to year.
