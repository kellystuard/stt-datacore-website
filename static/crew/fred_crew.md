Fred fits right in as part of Discovery’s final season TNG homage, though Timelines’ interpretation leaves a bit to be desired. This is a wholly skippable card, primarily because of the huge DIP/SCI/ENG kick that TP is on. He’s the seventh Legendary crew with his skill set released in 2024 and nearly double that amount have been printed in the last calendar year including mega recurring and giveaway options. His antimatter chances are at the bottom of that particular barrel and his overall utility is wanting.

With Discovery megas padding out much of his event history (never say never again), his Faction rate is sure to fall in the future and he obviously will never have variant bonuses to cushion the blow. Without ancillary attributes to benefit his value, Fred is a name to forget until and unless his collection tally grows to creep into your future retrieval list.
