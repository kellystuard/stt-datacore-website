“No.”







Ok you got me, here’s the real note – and see if you can find a recurring theme:
Is Todd Stashwick/Captain Liam Shaw the best thing born out of Trek in forever? YES.
Is the art on this card at least somewhat decent? Yes.
Is there any type of player that can find utility in this card? ...yes.

Well, by playing the most competitive and bugged Event in years, will I at least get four copies? ...no.
OK then, if I cite Shaw, will he be useful in Gauntlet, Arena or even Fleet Boss Battles? No.
Oh for ...OK grease monkey, riddle me this – does Shaw have any collections? NO.
.....So this card is for "dipshits"?

If you mean Nightmare Mode players, sure! He can voyage on those accounts (or early game players who had a spare cite!) where he gets some trait matches, but isn’t first in his class by a large margin. Only useful in arena if you love both accuracy boosts and positioning triggers, it’s doubtful you’ll find him aboard any ship in battle.

So what’s the value in this entry level Shaw?  A future Constable Collection.  Surely.  Totally.  Yeah.
No.
