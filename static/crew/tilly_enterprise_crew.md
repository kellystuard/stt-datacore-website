Yeah, it’s kinda fun to see Sylvia Tilly in TOS-era Sciences Division uniform, even though technically she could have worn this uniform if she wasn’t serving on Discovery and wearing the blue top and pants, right? The confusion of the costuming aside, please welcome another Timelines’ Original to help fill out that Vanity Collection and a new Legendary Tilly variant for all Discovery and Mary Wiseman enjoyers. 

Just Traity enough to grab a trio of Stat-Boosting Collections on debut, that’s where she’ll probably stay, unless the developers scrape the bottom of the Trait barrel for Theoretical Engineer. I know we’ve said it before but most of Tilly’s Event history comes from all those long-ago Discovery Mega Events, and until they show us they’re willing to bring them back again, you can realistically only price in variant and Trait-based opportunities henceforth. Debuting on the fringe of Voyage viability, Tilly’s got an interesting enough Skill set and order for her to hitch a ride, and given that those above her in her Skill Triplet are either Exclusives or not yet in the Time Portal, she’s not a bad choice to complete.
