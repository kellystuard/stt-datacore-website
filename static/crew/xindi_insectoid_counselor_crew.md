We should maybe be grateful that Bug's stubby Trait list has provided a few Collections so far, but for optimists there's a little room for growth there, especially if you believe the Resourceful Collection meant good things for the likes of the laughably large Desperate Trait pool. Donâ€™t expect any daily use from the Bug.
