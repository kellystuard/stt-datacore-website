Dicky Hill, as Mariner calls it, is apparently a favourite of Boimler’s. Makes sense that he’d try to emulate a famous captain as much as possible. Surely this is a Timelines Original, right? Nope, turns out it's from the Lower Decks comics! We really are spoiled for content these days.

Based on art alone, let me tell you that she’s already a favourite of mine. Goes well with Gangsters Kirk and Spock, plus Carlos Data and Scapegoat O’Brien. In fact, crap we need ships that allow five bridge characters, stat! How am I going to choose just four?! 

One thing you won’t struggle with, however, is finding some use for Mariner on your roster. Not a game breaker by any means, she still offers a nice set of Primary and Secondary Base numbers which will see all sorts of shuttle Event use thanks to a few rather popular traits. With her ENG skill leading the way, you can also get some perhaps longer-than-usual lasting Voyage viability out of this well-suited individual as well. Not bad for some 1940s Imagination Land cheesy detective story, eh?
