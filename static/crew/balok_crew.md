Balok is not cut from the Red Angel’s or Locutus’ cloth in that he won't dominate several areas of the game, but inside the mauler's pit, he does share their company in terms of raw Gauntlet power. He was mighty mighty before release, but Brickhouse Balok was granted a few tailored crit trait sets post-release to help him achieve his final form. 

Four 65% sets (as many as all other exclusives combined) and four 45% sets are an unnecessary number of opportunities for this CMD monster to completely manhandle the rest of the field. Balok was really the trendsetter as far as large numbers of tailored new Gauntlet crit sets, and follow-up Exclusives TKK, Fist Fight Archer, and The Giant Head have all gotten a half dozen unique sets just like him.

Balok being the numerical favorite in the majority of situations against Honor Hall purchase option Kahless the Unforgettable may be a big nail in the coffin of those who shun his 100,000 Honor price point. 

Balok will never Voyage for you (heck, he wasn’t gonna Voyage for anyone on day one of his release), but his Trait set, the key to his Gauntlet prowess, also delivers the potential for up to six more Collections.

All of this ensures that *every* roster will benefit from a copy of Clint Howard’s head!
