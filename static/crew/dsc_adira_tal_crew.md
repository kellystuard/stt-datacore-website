The Adira twins made a splash upon their inclusion to the game in more ways than one. Youngin’s can ask their grandparents about Adiragate, but alongside that noise was a pair of pretty attractive Voyagers. The emphasis, however, years later, is now on the word WAS in the previous sentence.

Having fallen far out of Voyage viability, EDF Adira has to parlay a lackluster Trait list into enduring value in terms of Collections and Event chances. They could find themselves with a quintet of the former if the stars align, and they have sizable Bases in the right two Skills to gain seating on your Faction Shuttles for variant or Trait bonus Events (and there’s always a chance of a Discovery Mega Event again).
