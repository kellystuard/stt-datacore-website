Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the Fifth House, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx, heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed is actually okay for a 2-skill Gauntleteer because of her ability to hit 65% crit. Unfortunately, that's just about all she offers. Her lack of Events and terrible Bases make chasing her spot in her three Collections a low value proposition. For one star, she's a fine Behold choice in some cases, but it's unwise to invest more than that until her Traits bear more Collection fruit, and we canâ€™t be sure of the inclusion of her Telepath trait or the Ambassador Collection (at least until WRG figures out why some crew are Ambassadors, some are Diplomats, and some are both).
