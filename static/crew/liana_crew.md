That’s it, that’s the note.

Ok, fine, we’ll review the card. Just about on the outside looking in on Voyages by now, Liana is more likely to be an affection Legendary Behold selection than one for objective gameplay reasons. A Trait set that’s about average will probably have her Bases living from Trait Mega Event to Mega Event while a modest Collection profile is at the mercy of WRG’s dartboard for value expansion. But until we get René Auberjonois’s character from the same episode, she’s going to remain the best Kantare in the game, bar none.
