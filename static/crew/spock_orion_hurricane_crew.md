Bloodwine? Check. Delaq? Check. Spock’s human half sure knows how to party! There’s certainly more than meets the eye to this old scientist. I heard that once he gets a few drinks in him, he even plays Wonderwall on his lute to impress Ardanan girls.

There are so many Spocks in this game it feels like they’re practically giving them away. In this case, they are. By which I mean, for a fee. But hey, as far as ÜberKampaign crew go, this certified BigBase™ option is pretty good! When you combine a popular Event name and trait list with stats like this, you know you’re going to see lots of dependable use over the years. There’s even great potential for Voyages in his spare time as a solid “nice to have” performer there, helping early adopters get extra mileage out of him. If you’re a non-spender, or this Campaign just isn’t right for you, Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Spock’s five Stat-Boosting Collections aren’t going anywhere, and there may even be a sixth by the time he hits Portal!
