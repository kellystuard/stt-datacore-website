No Cadet work takes Foxy out at the knees, while the lack of a third Skill dings any possible Voyage or Gauntlet dreams. His Collection value is the headliner and rightfully so. He's not a recommended crew to level too early, but will be one that every roster finishes sooner or later. Look to keep harvesting Collection bonuses from this tired-looking Ambassador long after you’ve forgotten who he is until you rewatch TOS and think “OH I KNOW THAT GUY!”
