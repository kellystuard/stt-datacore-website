Before she was the Chief Medical Officer of the Orville, Cassie was taking your order in a 60s diner via the latest installment of the “Far Beyond The Stars” crew debut.

“Can I start with strong Voyage power, please”? Why, sure you can! Unfortunately, it’s DIP/CMD as the top two Skills, but you can have ENG on the side.

“Will that be all?” Yes, that’ll be all. Cassie’s got little else to offer. What’s a Yates Event? Three Collections are below average by now, and sure, if you don’t have any of the other mass-produced Hull Repair options, go ahead and plug her in on your Fleet Boss Battles loadout. An Accuracy-Boost isn’t great, but it’s better than nothing.
