Welcome to everyone’s favorite gameshow...

“WHO...IS THAT...CREW????” 

That’s right! It’s time for a new episode where contestants try and figure out just who the hell this random new Tuesday crew is! Players, get your buzzers ready – it's time to guess today’s contestant.

"Although not credited, I have been seen in 36 episodes of Deep Space Nine, and even in Star Trek: Nemesis – and my real name is very Star Trek appropriate.”

...anyone?   

OK here’s clue #2: “I didn’t have any speaking lines, and my character was finally given a name in an opening sequence of the fifth season episode 'Children of Time', although I did not appear.” 

…No one buzzing in still. Here’s clue #3: 

“For a Super-Rare, I have OK Voyage use among END/DIP/SEC Triplets, but that will be limited to Nightmare Mode™ enjoyers, or players in the early game who have disposable Tuesday pack income. I do have acceptable Collection value at launch, with three up-front, but sadly none on the future horizon. My ship ability, with its strong Crit Bonus and increased ACC without a Trigger, will help a limited amount of players.” 

OK, final clue: 

“This out of work actress lives next door to unnamed WRG employee X, and every morning while walking his dog likes to remind said WRG employee that he was a star of Star Trek Deep Space Nine and should be immortalized in Star Trek Timelines with a stunning representation of her life's work.” 

BZZZT. 

Oh sorry players, no one rang in before the timer expired. We were looking for “Ensign Rita Tannenbaum”. Yes, that’s right, everyone’s background female ensign engineer aboard DS9 and at the Riker/Troi wedding, also named Ivy Borg in real life. 

Oh well, better luck next time to our contestants! Surely this will be the last episode of “WHO...IS THAT....CREW?” during the month of October and we won’t have to figure out a new crew that no one has ever seen nor heard of before. 

Surely.
