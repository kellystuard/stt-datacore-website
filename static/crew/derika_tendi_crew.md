The announcement of the Orion collection back in 2022 was almost cruel. We have to immortalize *which* crew?? We’ve come a long way since then courtesy of nuTrek, but there are still a lot of stinkers in that group and D'Erika, almost by virtue of the nature of power creep, is one of your best options.

That’s not to say she’s anything special otherwise. Her CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set should make veteran players’ eyes twitch and although TP has gotten better at diversifying over the years, Tendi still debuts as the thirteenth ranked CDS voyager despite a boosted score in the top sixty. 

Things look up elsewhere thanks to her traits. If a crew can grab seven or more without any Starfleet or Human shenanigans, they’re likely to have a juicy collection profile, and Tendi does. By rating it’s, again, unremarkable, but forward-thinking, handsome Big Book readers know that TP isn’t likely to halt collection additions any time soon and Tendi’s sheer number of viable traits give her a nice value ceiling you can look forward to her hitting. It’s also meant good things for her event work, granting her a bankable last four years with plenty of Faction Action.

On her own merits, D’Erika is not an impressive new crew, but there is longer-term value to be had and she’s among your best choices for the Alluring Pheromones collection.
