Her art makeover from melted crayon to hatchet man was the most exciting thing this Jadzia had done in ages, but her arguably generous inclusion in the Klingon Collection gave her value a spark. While Voyage power, Base oomph, Gauntlet, and Ship Ability are all missing in action, she's at least worth snagging for mid-game event work and a trio of stellar Collection spots.

Formerly exploitable niches of Voyage Skill set and lack of Dax SEC are both hamstrung by an abysmal relative power. With a handful of untapped Collection Traits lined up, Dax has probably hit rock bottom already and should climb back toward Collection piece over time.
