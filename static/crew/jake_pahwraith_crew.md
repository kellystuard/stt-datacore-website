We know that Emperor Palpatine Jake is the evil one because his eyes and swirly powers are on the red spectrum, while Kira’s are blue. They duke it out Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort style until, overcome by chronitons, they collapse in a draw. I wonder where those chronitons are now? Can they send some to us players in a giveaway?

This version of Jake may only be a Super Rare, while Kira’s is a Legendary, but he’s actually not that far off of her in terms of SEC base. He has absolutely nothing to offer in Gauntlet though, so it’s safe to say she wins this one. As usual with crew like this, most players will want to freeze him upon completion (plus, it hides that artwork) and simply reap the benefits of his three Stat-Boosting Collections and healthy potential for up to four more.
