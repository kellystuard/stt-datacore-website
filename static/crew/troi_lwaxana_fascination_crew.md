🎵I got Zanthi fever, it's burning in my brain
I've got Zanthi fever, it's driving me insane
We got Zanthi fever; we're flipping our bandanas
Been thinking ‘bout Odo so long, we’ve simply gone bananas!🎵

CMD/DIP/SCI crew continue to stay as in fashion as Lwaxana herself. This iteration of the overdone skill is therefore going to have a hard time separating itself from the pack to convince you to grab a copy if you’re not doing it for the art/a love of Majel. At first glance you might think “ooo, Voyages!”, and you’d be technically right. As a bonus, SCI is her secondary skill which separates her a bit from the more common CMD/DIP one-two punch. However the aforementioned jam-packed skillset means her utility will age far more poorly than Mrs. Barrett-Roddenberry ever did. There’s some Fleet Boss Battle viability here if you’ve yet to pick up one of the 25% Hull Repair crew, as she can be a serviceable stop-gap there while you wait to retrieve one of the usual suspects such as [insert whoever the current meta is at time of reading this note]. If you’re earning her during her debut as a Mega recurring card, you can certainly sleep well at night knowing your almost free four of five stars will get use in any lineup, nonetheless even newer players will have to weigh her benefits once she’s finally in the Portal and you no doubt already have clones of her on your roster.
