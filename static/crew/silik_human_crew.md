Lounging on the ash heap of cards buffed and still not good, Human Silik is kind of like running into your teacher at the grocery store…is that what he really looks like when not trying to intimidate Jonathan Archer? 

There are some attributes here which range from lemon-lime to burnt sienna on the scorecard and in totality make Silik an interesting card, but it’s not enticing enough for us to recommend him as a Tuesday pack dumpster dive. Without an elite stat to anchor his usage, Silik profiles better as an event card who you might stumble into two copies of and finish via a mix of next week’s event packs and a citation or two. 

If there’s something to look forward to here, it might just be his trait futures. There are a handful of viable event and collection tags which to date have been unviable, but that could turn around on a dime and don’t you want to ride the crest of the wave? A mid-level offering who’s a reasonable choice to finish, Silik is just on the wrong side of winning our dilithium and citing up from star one.
