Benny Sisko’s old pal Cal wears a stylish mustard vest and is missing visible arms, and also missing any semblance of a crew you’d want to dive into a Tuesday Pack for, unless you’re a real big fan of this particular arc on Deep Space Nine. On the verge of being DOA for Voyages for a 2023 Legendary Crew, Calvin’s plus Skill set may as well be tossed IN the Hudson (that’s a River in New York City for those who aren’t aware) since he doesn’t have the power to use it. 

Just a single Collection on debut, at best he’s a long-term Trait investment to see if any of his other five Viable Traits hit paydirt someday. If you like to have fun with Ships, Calvin also has a 400% Instant Damage Ability handcuffed to a Position Trigger, and a slow 10s Activation.
