Full Cadet Missions eligibility is great to see, though her somewhat weak Secondary and Tertiary Skills may struggle with Epic Difficulty Node unlocks thanks to a lack of most of the relevant SCI-centric Traits. Luckily the utility doesn’t end there.

A Bones-esque Grand Slam Shuttler, Tendi debuts as the top option for all MED (“and”) seats available and has a juicy early game Skill set to pair with great Voyage power that should see her perform there alongside Rare options. With worthwhile Collection value as well, Tendi is a fine choice for your precious Trainers at any stage of the game.
