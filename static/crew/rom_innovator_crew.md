Yet another entry into the prospective and not-at-all-imaginary Prop and Seated Collections, Innovator Rom delighted DS9 and Lower Decks enjoyers with a crossover voice appearance from Max Grod√©nchik and delights STT enjoyers with a long-overdue strong Legendary Rom variant. 

As Grand Nagus, Rom has surely acquired all the necessary Traits to give himself and Leeta a comfortable lifestyle, and here they all are! Five Stat-Boosting Collections plus four more untapped Traits with a wide variety of viability give him long-term value even after his Voyage power wanes. For now though, he should have enough to fly on your Voyages for a while, and when his name is called on the weekend his top two Skills are ready and willing to 99% your Faction Shuttles.
