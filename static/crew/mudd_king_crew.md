Holy Cow. They got the Roger Carmel rights and the floodgates have opened. Nevermind that they didn’t need to give us good stats on crew that a lot of longtime fans of the franchise would have snapped up - they did.

There isn’t a ton of utility here and we would have loved to have seen Mudd as perhaps some overpowered exclusive crew, but he has your typical base and voyage daily use on lockdown. CMD/DIP/Whatever is way overplayed and Mudd lacks the antimatter percentages that could launch him into a top ten rating, but with raw power aplenty, he profiles as a three-year-plus voyager for the average player.

Likewise, a top ten CMD base debut may have to grab some non-bonus Faction work because despite a healthy number of variant events for such a minor character, he’s had a few barren years. Considering this is more a work of art than workhorse, we’re just happy to see a crew that we can use every week on our rosters.
