We’re still waiting for Captain Angel’s relationship with Sybok to pay off in Strange New Worlds, Season 3 or Season 4 or hopefully Season 10 (please Paramount, let us have 10 seasons), but until then, here is an aggressively-average CMD/ENG/SEC Legendary Crew with a thin Trait list and even thinner long-term prospects. But… some of these niche Traits could find themselves with associated Collections before long, and when all is said and done, Captain Angel could have themselves a quintet of tick marks on Stat-Boosting Collections.
