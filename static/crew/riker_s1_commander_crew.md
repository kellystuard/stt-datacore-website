The most fascinating thing involving this crew since the game launched was how he wrongly sported the Trill trait for over a year before WRG bothered to fix it. However, now that his traits are materializing into collections, heâ€™ll at least earn his Crew Slot briefly as you pay a perfunctory build cost with Items primarily coming from Away Missions. Will Riker? - a great officer and an even greater question.
