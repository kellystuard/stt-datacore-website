I bet you were expecting a ton of Indian cuisine jokes in this note, weren't you? Well, there'll be Nhan of that Nhansense here, this is a professional endeavor, written by professionals.

Nhan's still viable on voyages and her ENG secondary does a great job of breaking up an all too common SEC/CMD stack. Unfortunately her traits let her down and won't elevate a fairly common overall skill set that could use the help.

Rachael Ancheril welcomes us to Timelines Talks and this note will introduce you to the best Barzan in the game, bar none. Low bar, but we clear it with great aplomb.

Nhan has parlayed not one but two of her hidden traits into Collections, but that will probably be it for this Security Officer. She’s also aged out of Voyages despite a lovely Skill Set and Order, and unfortunately she has little else left to offer the player.

We can only hope WRG didn’t revive Discovery Mega Events just to kill them off again, and if we see more, her big SEC Base will help your Faction Event prowess even at a low Fusion level.
