I don’t know about you, but when a deity kidnaps me and forces me into combat, to the death, with a strange lizard alien, I tend to not put them on the Holiday gift list. However, if your Secret Santa got you a bag of DIL, then I think you know where your fight will be...

No, not Cestus III, a Tuesday Pack! That’s right, if you haven’t gotten enough of Terrible Tuesday Trauma, then good news everyone! It’s another Mixed Behold pack that wants to separate you from your currency in a battle to the poorhouse, where the winner gets a somewhat decent new card!

Debuting in a cluttered SCI/DIP/CMD skillset, Metron does make use of 6 Antimatter Trait seats, being the best Crafty crew available. However others, like Inspiring Burnham, Lt. Commander Spock and Pathfinder Uhura, will often steal those Voyage seats first. Metron also has some muscle-flexing as the new #2 SCI Base (let’s see how long this note goes before being outdated) and will ride shuttles for you weekly. The other godly feature, should you want to gamble away your money, is three Stat-Boosting Collections at launch and at least two more in the clouds.

Beyond those selling points, the TOS episode ‘Arena’ is the only Arena this card will show up in, as Ship Battles or Events are not going to have a fighter's chance. Personally I wouldn’t bow to this guy, unless it’s a toga party.
