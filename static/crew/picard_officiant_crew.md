Duty. A BigBook writer’s life is filled with solemn duty. I have commanded men in filling note backlogs. I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable opinions on tiering. I have represented the BigBook in first contact with twenty-seven alien Redditors. But none of this compares with my solemn duty today... as Officiant Picard’s representative. Now, I know, on an occasion such as this, it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this Giveaway card, but has WRG considered what they were doing to me? Of course the players are happy, but what about *my* needs? This is all a damned inconvenience. While they're happily settling in on an Objective Event that will net them a further three copies, I will be forced to evaluate if he’s any good while being watched over by the keeper of the code! You all know him. He's a tyrannical martinet who will never, *ever*, allow me to get paid for this job!

“That is the regulation, sir. BigBook code section 12, paragraph 4. He should be quite useful on Voyages however, I assure you. The DIP/ENG pairing will age quite well. Although his DIP base isn’t good enough to do anything other than catch a ride on an extra rental shuttle during a Picard Faction event…”

Mr. Namer…

“Sir?”

Shut up.

“Yes, sir.”

Two and a half years I've been waiting to say that.
