Almost five and a half years later and we have our second entry from the classic Kirk “Risk is our Business” speech episode, Return to Tomorrow. Please consider this the Big Book’s official demand that, some time in the next five and a half years, we get a Timelines Original Shyaporn Theerakulstit as Kirk giving that speech.

A strong Voyager as he enters the game during his run as the Mega Recurring Legendary, this Spock variant adds a nice touch of MED to the SCI/SEC rota. If he’s not riding one of his many possible Antimatter bonus seats, he may well be Eventing for you as a top variant option for both SCI and SEC. His currently ten-wide trait list and reliable name recognition have been called to the plate many times before, with surely umpteen more to come. If that weren’t all, a brand new Collection thanks to “The Shadow Within” could be followed up by up to four more, making your…possession…of this crew a wise investment!
