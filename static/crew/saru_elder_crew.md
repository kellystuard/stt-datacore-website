Why did TPG stop making two-Skilled crew (more affectionately known as “Skillets”)? Elder Saru doesn’t know, but we do! Generally, without niche usefulness outside of Voyages…they STINK! Does Saru stink? Read more!

Well, this Saru has a solid DIP Base for Continuum Missions, Shuttles, and Events. Plus, he has a Secondary CMD Base which is also viable for the latter. Verdict: Saru demonstrates his value there, and also with his Trait list. A quintet of Collections at unboxing makes him a solid candidate for day one Immortalization, and it stands to reason he could end up with seven before long.
