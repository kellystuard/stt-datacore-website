Not the best 2* ENG nor the best 2* SEC but scores major points for being able to participate in all the weekday Cadet Missions and being in the Cardassian collection. After Cadets are finished it’s probably best to move her into the freezer as it’s doubtful you don’t have a better engineer by then. If you aren’t going to finish Seska for Cadets, finish her for her Trait set, which should bear the fruit of up to two more in the future.
