Despite an exciting skill set for new players and voyages, Dysek is more level Red than level Blue (that’s the mandatory episode pull, but worth the watch). WRG is running through Itzin’s characters following the actor’s passing and as top notch Legendary offerings like Admiral Black and Ilon Tandro get snapped up, that leaves scraps for the Super Rare crowd.

Debuting as an event reward, Dysek is certainly worth the effort for new players. An attractive MED/CMD stack will serve you well early on voyages and his primary base is stout enough to handle Galaxy map nodes. He even has a few collections relevant to players of all experience levels. The issue is a lack of noteworthy attributes for ships, gauntlet, or events and a power level on voyages that could be invalidated by just a couple stars on an equivalent Legendary option.

Welcome him aboard via his introductory event, but if approaching him in a behold, base your decision almost solely on his collection portfolio.
