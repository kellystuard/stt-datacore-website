We are not afforded the luxury of choosing the crew we fall in love with. Do you think Worf is anything like the crew I thought I’d choose? He is an inept, shallow, arrogant man who shares my Event Shuttles far too frequently for my taste. And yet...I love him deeply. We Big Bookers often tout our prowess at rating crew, our desire for Tiers and Honor above all else. But how hollow is the sound of a Skirmish victory without someone to share it with. Crew Slots give little comfort to a man alone in his roster, and in his heart.

Groom’s (narrow) role as Shuttle anchor is locked-in, just note that due to a pitiful Trait set, he’s not 100% retrievable should you wish to avoid that inevitable twinge of regret when your Klingon Collection sits at 59/60 and you see Worf’s silhouette.
