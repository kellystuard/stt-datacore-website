‘Give me your hand. Your hand. Now feel that. Human flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it, Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies.’

Do we need more generic variants in game? A lot of players would say no, but the above speech which Kirk’s ship quote is pulled from is part of why he, and Trek by extension, is legendary. So give me this smug-faced variant, or ‘Risk is our business’ Kirk, even if they’re not wearing goofy hats and outfits.

James T. debuts with a lofty tier rating and by the numbers he seems to earn it. A big CMD base (topping tier 1’s Chances Taken variant) pairs well with Kirk’s myriad events. He is and will be among the leaders in raw event numbers forever with this variant snags even more from a handful of viable traits. Those also grant him a five collection debut with a little room for expansion there.

With serviceable voyage work and a ship ability worth tinkering with, there’s every reason to acquire this “generic” version of the legend that launched the Star Trek franchise.
