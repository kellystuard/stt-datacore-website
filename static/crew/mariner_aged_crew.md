Mariner’s voyage and gauntlet numbers may as well be as old as she is, but there are a few intriguing attributes here. Her big ENG base, surprisingly not even top three among the various run-n-gun Mariner variants, is certainly worth thawing for events. Mainly, though, we’re going to be tinkering with her on ships.

Charge abilities are tricky to navigate. They don’t play well with auto mode and most of them activate after you’re dead in the Arena. But even Mariner’s base ability is interesting thanks to a lightning quick four second initialization. Anything lower than six seconds is a rarity and that hefty baseline crit bonus could be a component in an off-meta lineup for either ship-based game mode.

Ultimately Mariner may be destined to land in the freeze and forget pile off the back of her smattering of collections, but there’s at least a dash of uniqueness here for players to tinker with.
