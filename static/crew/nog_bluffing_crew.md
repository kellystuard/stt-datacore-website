The best Noggles ever? Possibly. Tux Nog’s collection count and voyage power used to be formidable…back in my day. But in a world where you’re allowed to use more than one, this version’s not bad either.

Nog’s voyage work headlines here and although it’s a bit concerning how many Legendary crew with his skill set are being churned out lately, he at least sits at the top of the heap. He has a headlock on less competitive antimatter seats like Ferengi and Survivalist and in his specific skill order, there are scant options in the top 300 vRanks. 

More well-rounded than most crew, Nog also offers fine collection value, both current and with a high ceiling. On ships, his attack-boosting uptime is high among his triggerless instant damage peers to offset a lower total boost. That kind of tinkering to find everybody a niche is something WRG should have explored more years ago when FBB was first added.

If this were Big Book Classic and Nog came up during one of our nightly tiering sessions, he’d indeed debut right where he has - as a crew you should move all in for.
