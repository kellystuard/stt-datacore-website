Welcome to everyone’s favorite gameshow.... 

“WHO...IS THAT...CREW????” 

That’s right! It’s time for a new episode where contestants try and figure out just who the hell this random new Tuesday crew is! Players, get your buzzers ready – it's time to guess today’s contestant.

“I was in two episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise – during the Xindi war arc of Season Three. My first appearance was as a background character – and then I was recast with a different actor and broguht back to toast with Degra to the success of the weapon.”

…anyone?   

OK here’s clue #2: “I didn’t have any speaking lines until later and I wasn’t named in the show except for in the producers notes and guides after the fact.” 

...No one buzzing in still. Here’s clue #3: 

“For a Super-Rare, I have OK Voyage use among ENG/CMD/SCI Triplets, but that will be limited to Nightmare Mode™ enjoyers, or players in the early game who have disposable Tuesday pack income. I do have great Collection value at launch, with three up-front and another trio coming soon™.  My ship ability, with its strong Crit Bonus and increased ACC without a Trigger, will help a limited amount of players.” 

OK, final clue: 

“This out of work actor lives next door to unnamed WRG employee X, and every morning while walking his dog likes to remind said WRG employee that he was a star of Star Trek Enterprise and should be immortalized in Star Trek Timelines with a stunning representation of his life's work.”

BZZZT. 

Oh sorry players, no one rang in before the timer expired. We were looking for “Thalen”. Yes, that’s right, everyone’s favorite unnamed Xindi assistant, Thalen.

Oh well, better luck next time to our contestants! Surely this will be the last episode of “WHO...IS THAT...CREW?” during the month of October and we won’t have to figure out a new crew that no one has ever seen nor heard of before.

Surely.
