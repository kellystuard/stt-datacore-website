With the art looking like Will is ready to engage an unseen assailant in the ancient Klingon art of Mok’bara, Night Terrors Riker isn’t so sleepy a Super Rare crew. Debuting in the upper reaches of his Rarity in terms of Voyage power, and with all the benefits of consistent Riker Events, you might find this particular variant on the short list for thawing when there’s a Faction weekend. A little light on both Traits and clothing, and with an Instant Damage Ship Ability unfortunately shackled to a Boarding Trigger, this Crew will spend most of his time in Cryostasis.
