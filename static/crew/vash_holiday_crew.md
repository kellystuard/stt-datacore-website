A giveaway for the fine connoisseurs of Barbara Eden/BarBara Luna hairstyles, Vash isn’t exactly one for the stats nerds. Her sunset scorecard speaks to a lack of utility and power with her top offerings reliant on a SCI base soon to slip from the top twenty ranks. 

As with other Vash variants, the key here lies with her trait set. A pair of unique quipment items gives her some room to maneuver in Continuum Missions and the likes of Smuggler and Merchant traits will probably see their collection drop amidst a swarm of low-tier options you’ll be picking through to find fuse-worthy options. Unless you’re a new player for whom this would be your first fully fused SCI primary Legendary, simply hold on to the copies you already have as behold insurance and finish her at a later date.
