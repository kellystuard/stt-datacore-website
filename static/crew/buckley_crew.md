“It tastes awful, and it works.” That’s the tagline for a notably nasty yet effective Canadian cold medicine under the name of Buckley’s. Unfortunately for our friend here, no amount of gross liquid was ever going to stop a bunch of Gorn hatchlings from doing their best Chest Burster impression and sending him off to join the choir invisible.

Easily the best…member of his unknown species currently in the game, Buckley is not necessarily destined for the freezer after his debut event! The first Super Rare crew in a while to have some Gauntlet use, Buckley will be a welcome addition to many less fleshed out rosters/those missing a number of the Gauntlet Exclusive crew. His one 65% Crit set so far ironically includes EV Suit Gorn, but he’ll have a fighting chance this time unlike aboard the Peregrine. Not much else to talk about here (the uptime and trigger render his Ship Battle Bonus largely DOA), but I’ll take a new non-exclusive addition to the Gauntlet ranks any day!
