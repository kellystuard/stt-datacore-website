MMA OWO, as she will inevitably become known (just wait, it'll happen), is a crew that you don't need to have, but if you have her, you might use her sometimes. Yes, what a glowing recommendation!

No longer fighting in the “Heavyweight Voyager” weight class, her only remaining attributes are an interesting-at-best Ship Ability as an Attack Boost option, and a quintet of Collections, placing her well above average in that category, with perhaps a sixth waiting for the bell to ring. Ding Ding!
