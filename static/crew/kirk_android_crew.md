Burnham and Picard sometimes get flak for "leaning slightly left" variant art, but you can't tell me that Evil and Android Kirks aren't the same guy at different points in the Macarena.

You may wish to acclimate yourself to his boring appearance, however, because he's a trustworthy Event name. Kirk's storied weekend prowess meets a few off-brand Traits to hopefully spike month-long bonuses and slip him into a few Collections. Not the most inspirational card on your roster, but certainly not without his uses.
