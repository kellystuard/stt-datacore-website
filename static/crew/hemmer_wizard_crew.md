Never thought there’d be a Beryozka reference in the Big Book, but doesn’t it kinda look like it? As Hemmer was gliding into our hearts throughout season one (and back out again), this may have been the peak of his endearment to the fans. As such, and because future seasons won’t be providing too many more variants, a bit more playable stats would have been appreciated.

His rank five debut SCI base is the headliner here, but that doesn’t matter much for daily shuttles (which also don’t matter much) and his traits have yet to consistently translate into event bonuses, leaving him with spotty non-bonus work if he can find it. 

Hemmer’s voyage power is more of a concern, coming in at the thirteen spot in his skill set on debut. With many of those top names being added in the past year, it’s clear that TP has the skill set in mind and Hemmer may tumble down the ranks faster than in years past.

With several recent crew also snagging a charging crit bonus ability, he’s sadly not unique there either and seems destined to end up as a future retrieval project for players who grabbed a copy or two in his event and (rightfully) let him eat a crew slot for quite a while.
