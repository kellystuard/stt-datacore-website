Never thought there’d be a Beryozka reference in the Big Book, but doesn’t it kinda look like it? As Hemmer was gliding into our hearts throughout season one (and back out again), this may have been the peak of his endearment to the fans. As such, TP’s post-release stat buff is much appreciated.

Hemmer’s shiny new proficiencies catapult him into relevance in a few different areas. In the Gauntlet, he becomes a nice B+ player behind the long-smothering Red Angel who shares his skill set and he’s a top ten option in a handful of different gauntlets. Despite not owning giant 65% crit sets like exclusive options, his plus skill set and strong proficiencies will do the heavy lifting to grind out dice rolling wins.

Those same positive attributes grant him intriguing Goyage (and Voyage) potential. Despite TP loading up that skill set in recent times, his power level is certainly adequate and his proficiency power laps the field among top shelf voyage names. With an acceptable collection portfolio and niche shipboard ability, there’s plenty to like about Hemmer’s shining moment.
