*Slaps roof of Timelines* This bad boy can fit so many Klingon Politicians in it.

Too much time spent studying Klingon politics will make your eyes cross. If you covered the nameplates of the different Chancellors, it would be nearly impossible to tell them apart. That means two things in practical terms; none of them stand out apart from Gowron's Gauntlet ability and if you love K'mpec, you might want to grab a copy before he becomes impossible to 100% retrieve.

If you do own a copy or three of K'mpec from his Event or the Mega Event Recap Packs of an otherwise statistically impressive Mega Event, we advise a slow burn Fusion process consisting of him saving your bacon in otherwise poor Beholds. He's an alright Collection/Event combo piece, but offers nothing statistically significant or unique in any corner of the game.
