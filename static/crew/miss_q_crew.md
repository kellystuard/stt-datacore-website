"Fan favorite Suzie Plakson" is all some people need to hear, but let's go over her gameplay considerations anyways. 

Until recently with a crush of stronger Super Rares, Miss Q was viable on Voyages in the early game, but now you can find superior options in weekly Events and in the free Campaign. Unfortunately John de Lancie’s Q gets most of the Event features slated for members of the Q Continuum, but the mother of his child does seem to find some work with her Traits. Speaking of, she has a solid set of five, and by the end of it all she may have a quintet of corresponding Collections. She’s a fine long-term investment for her Rarity.
