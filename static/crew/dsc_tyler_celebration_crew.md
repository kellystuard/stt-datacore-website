Luau Ash's usage flipped almost overnight, going from Event juggernaut and strong Voyage crew to now Collection fodder. Discovery Mega Event days of yore may never again pluck him from Cryostasis, although a handful of other Traits will pop from time to time alongside scattered Tyler Events. 

Tyler's trio of Collections should be joined by his other Traits before too long to help keep his value afloat, even if heâ€™s not much of a daily option any longer.
