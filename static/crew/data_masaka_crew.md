“Mmm...I am getting sleepy. You always do that to me.” Um, didn’t Data tell us that Masaka was waking a little bit ago? Which personality is he showcasing right now? Never mind.

Coming to us from what is widely considered to be an episode of Star Trek, Data as Yawn Another Boring Honour Hall Crew debuts as an overpriced nice-to-have for elderly players. Beaten out in almost every way that matters by already-in-the-Portal AGIMUS, can I possibly convince you to part with your hard earned honour on this venerable sun goddess? Let’s see…

Accuracy Boost with a Trigger on Ship Battles? Meh. Voyage skillset surpassed in all ways by the previously mentioned cartoon Combs? Pssh. Event Potential? Only if you care about ENG seats in a few niche traits or suspect they’ll run a Cyberneticist Mega again. Collections? Ok…maybe? He’s got two Stat-Boosting ones accounted for and a good shot at three or four more down the line, so perhaps he’s not completely useless after all. But then, we expect a lot more out of our Honour Hall crew than “not completely useless”, don’t we? Unless you’re a member of the Collector’s Guild or just a big fan, this BigBook writer votes that you continue your hunt another day.
