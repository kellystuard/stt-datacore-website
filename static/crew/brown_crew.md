If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits the portal, you're gonna see some serious shit. (It’s ok. We’re allowed to swear if it’s a direct quote.)

It is Unfortunate. Terribly Unfortunate. that Doc Brown was a pack-only crew because the two avenues he has to contribute - voyages and shuttles - require you to fuse him up and that’s much more easily done via threshold rewards in an event. So while his mid-tier debut doesn’t spell disaster on paper, you’re paying far more per pound of production than you would for any number of other similar crew.

If you’re reading this from the future, first of all you're about fifteen years late for Stephen Hawking’s time traveller party. Secondly, while it’s not worth fishing for copies to fuse Brown up for his daily contributions, there may exist a world in which he’s reached four of five collections, which is the point where he’s worth targeting in beholds.
