Burnham, Burnham, Burnham! I'm sick to death of hearing about Burnham! Burnham Brady strikes again with another useful crew, including the first showing of MED from the character to get her on the scoreboard across all six Skills.

Her unicorn Skill set and order buoy a decaying Voyage score among Super Rares, but you want her for her Traits; two Collections for now and Traits for up to two more. Even though Discovery is ending after 5 seasons, it does seem like even concluded shows can find themselves slated for Mega Events, and Burnham Events do seem to come up more often than many others.
