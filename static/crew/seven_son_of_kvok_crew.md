To paraphrase Kirk Van Houten, I don't like the idea of Timelines Players earning two Gauntlet crew in one Event. But then, I didn’t go to Gudger College, and this is the wrong Kirk to listen to as a Star Trek fan.

That’s right, this male-Klingon-channeling Daughter of Magnus is quite the prize! Packing a mighty SEC/ENG punch with a respectable CMD kicker, the fifteenth Seven to grace our game is a close approximation of the Exclusive Bridge Worf and comes right on the heels of Ux-Mal O’Brien (talk about a kick in the nards to his utility). Move over, PSLs, it’s Gauntlet Season and I’m gonna be my Basic Bitch best about it. With plenty of traits to go around, she’ll stand out on her own in many a Gauntlet “Top 5”, away from the harsh glare of her “fellow” Klingon. Stats like these will maintain their relevance for a while, so getting that first star in a BeGold once she enters Portal will always be the right choice.
