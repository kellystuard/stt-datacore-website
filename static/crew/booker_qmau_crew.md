Booker is statistically “whatever” (that’s the technical term), so let’s take a minute to gush about his artwork. An easy “of the year” contender, you’d expect a little dagger dripping poison to be hanging from his hip. He’s maxed out his points in stealth and bartering and practically lives in dark alleys. 

That inconspicuousness unfortunately translates to his numbers as he’s nondescript in almost every area of the game. Over half of his event bonuses are Discovery megas while his primary base debuted ranked in the fifties. His collection ceiling, while mid-level, needs several cards to fall right in order for him to reach that potential and his respectable rank on ships requires a position trigger which can be finicky to satisfy and players have historically eschewed triggers for easier ‘fire and forget’ setups.

His standout contribution comes on voyages. Although his power doesn’t quite reach into the “later, losers!” part of the power curve, it’s strong enough when paired with an underrepresented skill set. The venerable Faction store reward Mirror Tuvok sits at the top and Continuum Mission all-star Sisko right behind, but after those names (and Booker), there’s a bit of a drop with most names behind him in power not offering much for utility either.

If you’re an art fanatic, say no more and you’ll get some voyage use out of Book in the short term. But if you’re a stats geek first and foremost, we advise you look elsewhere to satisfy the citations burning a hole in your pockets.
