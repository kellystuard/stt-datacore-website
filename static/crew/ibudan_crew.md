Zero Gooey Grilled Cheese Fingers out of ten. The character art brief “team” at Tilting Point definitely got to the point in the episode where Mr. Collins from the Power Rangers showed up and said “I think we’re done here. Give this crew to Artist #2.”

An ostensibly interesting skill set belying Ibudan’s drab attire is probably going to sucker in a lot of players who are looking for voyage ability. While that might sound harsh for, again, an awesome voyage skill order, his antimatter chances are awful for a crew sporting MED and his power profiles where you’d want a crew to sit after a couple years of use. 

That being said, if fed citations on day one, Ibudan could contribute there from time to time and in concert with an eclectic set of traits for the occasional event bonus and a high collection ceiling, he’s an intriguing crew whose value is limited by his debut power more than any ancillary attributes. 

He compares similarly to former Tier 1 crew Warship EMA - same skill set, off-beat trait set, ship damage - except that EMA is tiered similarly to Ibudan after *six* years of service on your roster. We advise you add stars passively when possible and look to eventually reap a big collection windfall down the line.
