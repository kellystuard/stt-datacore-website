Another crew from Very Short Treks and another CMD/DIP/SCI Skill set: which recent trend should we poo poo here? WC Riker, or Water Closet Riker for short, Will here has enough juice to give him a solid debut Big Book Tier but we don’t anticipate it being lofty for long. The top 50 debut Voyager power is misleading; he’s 7th in his triplet, telling you clearly that the Skill set is tired and overused. The good news is five Collections, including the new hotness of Saboteur, and with Riker Events never far away and Trait-bonus features peppered in, his CMD Base will come to play.
