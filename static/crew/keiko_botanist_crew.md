With *checks notes* too many crew in the game, we’re no longer worried about hitting the word count here at the Big Book. She’s a common card with but a single skill, you can do the math. Only Keiko’s collections matter here, but just make sure that you can handle the number of Science Experiments required to finish her - in the early game those are usually better spent on crew who contribute to your active roster.
