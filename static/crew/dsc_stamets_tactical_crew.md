On debut, Tactical Stamets had a nearly peerless Voyage power in his Skill Set, but two years later he finds himself on the outside looking in and leaking plasma.

Stamets should be good for a few Events per year since Discovery Mega Events made a surprising return (dead cat bounce?) and Paul remains “main cast” on a current-airing but ending show. His Gauntlet prowess looks deceptive, but he could be part of a “road less traveled” team if you like to have fun like that. Don’t look for Stamets to hit more than one more Collection, so you may not want to spend your Crew Retrievals or Behold choices on him when there are stronger and Traitier options out there.
