From the first on-screen appearance of the Tholians, Loskene hops (we assume they could probably hop with those six legs) into the game via a Tuesday Pack as the first Legendary variant of his species. An edgecase Voyage option on debut and two decent Bases for Shuttles, that’s about where the interesting details end. A slow Instant Damage Ability coming online at 8s doesn’t do much to whet our whistle, and until more of the Commander’s unrealized Collection Traits become realized, he won’t be appearing on any Citation or Retrieval lists.
