We’d love to see this card as the lesser half of a Burnham and Tilly fusion crew, maybe with the payoff Legendary hailing from season five’s ‘Whistlespeak’ as a testament to the journey of their friendship. That would also make her the best pre-fused option to date.

The base and voyage ability is there for early-to-mid game players and nobody can ever definitively say that we’re not getting another Discovery mega. I used to hate that fact and now find it oddly comforting. Bunham also comes pre-packaged with a quartet of collections which, while unremarkable these days, still puts her ahead of many hundreds of other Super Rares and in the crosshairs of veteran Timelines players. This is a green light acquisition for children of all ages.
