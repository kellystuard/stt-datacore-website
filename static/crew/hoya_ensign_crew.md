Dies immediately? Resourceful! Whether you like nitpicking traits or why characters you’ve never heard of are *the best* at something, Hoya has something for everybody.

Miraculously dodging the tier ten debut death knell, Hoya is more than fine for plug-n-play daily use on early-to-midgame rosters. #1s across the board for voyages should see her mingling with partially fused gold crew on your roster and in between those long hauls, she’ll be at home flying your shuttles around the Gamma Quadrant. Her long term prospects for collection value and thawpertunities are bleak so use it or lose it!
