Anyone else getting Billy Joel vibes? We’ll skip the We Didn’t Start The Fire parody lyrics and supposition on why Gregory Itzin needed to die before WRG decided to add any of his characters to the game. He’s here now and we’re glad of that.

A tier two debut never looked so dull. No, we’re not haters, but we have to trust the process or else Big Book corporate gets involved and it becomes a whole thing. This is the space where we’d normally boast about Tandro’s #1 CMD/DIP/SEC voyage score, but it being the most common in the game means that rank could be outdated before the ink dries on this note. In fact, he debuts as one of three crew in his skill *order*, not just skill set, among the top ten voyagers. If you find our message about CMD/DIP/SUCK redundant, keep in mind it’s still less redundant than the skill set itself.

Those common skills do serve Charles well for shuttles, however. Even without a ‘Top X’ base rank, he’ll catch plenty of seats, even though he’s had fewer weekend bonuses to date than the length of his trait list might suggest. His collection portfolio is mildly deceiving as well, given that a few of his trait pools are either singular or comically large.

We’ve been doing this long enough to know that it’s impossible to fight public opinion on a crew whose point of entry grants the user four or more stars right off the bat. And to his credit, Itzin will fly quite a lot for you between voyages and shuttles. At the start, anyways. But as an ÜberKampaign offering costing the user real world money, Tandro is simply too stock standard and too replaceable for us to expect him to hold up excellently in the long term.
