We wonâ€™t bury the lede here - for Fleet Boss Battles, you need Hull Repair crew and Laborer Kirk is a must have. Best-in-class at a 25% Hull Repair with a 20s Cycle time, he pairs well with an Attack Boost Hull Repair crew like Dereth or First Officer Chekov along with one or two Instant Damage or Crit Bonus crew in the current meta.

Outside of this obvious need if you are going to compete in FBB, Laborer Kirk is first and foremost a Kirk, so count on variant Event bonuses regularly, even though he has an ENG Primary Skill. A few more Traits should pay off on Collections, giving him a ceiling of four or five when all is said and done.
