You can run from it. Hide from it. CMD/DIP/SUCK will find you.

Sinister earned a reputation quickly after release and has definitely performed well to date, but he’s been hammered in his strongest area; Voyages. Everywhere from Events to Tuesday Packs to Mega Events to giveaways, the CDS Skill set has flooded the top of the Voyage charts and is calling for Picard’s demise a lot sooner than maybe he deserves. That sounds alarmist, especially considering his primo set of Antimatter seats, but he’s no longer that name which was on the lips of everyone mulling their first Crew Retrieval.

The good news is Sinister is still a fun character. You can stretch his Proficiencies into Gauntlet ability thanks to a quartet of 45% Crit sets and reliable Picard Events in league with some viable bonus Traits have given him plenty of chances at piloting Shuttles on weekends. His meager Collection count is sure to grow, so Sinister Picard remains a solid card. Now c’mon, say his name in a saucy French accent.
