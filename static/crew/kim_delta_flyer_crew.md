If you come across multiple copies of DF Kim in short order, he should perform fine for younger rosters on Voyages, but Voyages are not typically an attribute you should chase in Super Rare Beholds, given how large the Time Portal is and how long it can take to “target” adding stars to specific crew.

Of more lasting value; a Base worth thawing for Kim Events (don’t laugh) that have been far more plentiful than compliments from Captain Janeway. His three viable Traits have each contributed something in the way of Event bonuses and are as likely as any to join the Collection ranks before the ink dries on this crew note.
