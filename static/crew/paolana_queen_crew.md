Like any good mother, Paolana just wants her son to get laid and become king, and she’ll stop at nothing to make that happen. Is that too much to ask?

Well, spoiler alert, but yes, yes it is. Because apparently Billups would rather exercise his free will and pursue his true passion, engineering, instead of engaging in extracurriculars with any of the many attractive suitors he had vying for his attention. Sounds just like my University experience…

Anywho, Queen Paolana is a bit of a run-of-the-mill Super Rare crew who is bound for the cryo freezer on most rosters. With four Stat-Boosting Collections to her name and a good chance at three more down the road, she’s a solid investment for anyone playing her Event anyway, or coming across her in a Behold in the future. If you’re a newer player, she comes with a smattering of Gauntlet use too, which as a friendly reminder only needs that first copy. Lastly, as with most of the Lower Decks crew, it’s some excellent art, as well as another entry into the unofficial Drinking Collection.
