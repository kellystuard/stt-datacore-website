Omelette du Fromage isn’t just not this crew’s name, it’s also not the correct French translation for Cheese Omelette. That’s the last time we take language lessons from you, Dexter!


Thankfully we’re not here to educate you on romance, we’re here to talk about another Gauntlet Exclusive Crew! Replacing Power Ransom as the featured (and therefore best chance) reward on launch, Omet’iklan holds the rank of First, both in the Jem’Hadar military structure and in most of his Proficiency Pairings! A certifiable beast in SEC/ENG and SEC/MED pairings, you’d be a fool not to take him in a Gauntlet Behold and level him ASAP. As if that weren’t enough, he also boasts a hearty +16000 Crit Bonus/+10 Attack in Ship Battles, quite handy if you Immortalize him (especially so if you don’t wish to retrieve Vox from the Honour Hall). 

Should you find yourself with an Immortalized copy, lay waste to any and all Jem’Hadar who break their vow of allegiance by unlocking a Quipment slot or two to beef him up even more. Further icing on the cake is his place in four Stat Boosting Collections and a trait list that could see four more before this game rides off into the sunset.
