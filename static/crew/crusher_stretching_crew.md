I don’t like the idea of Timelines having two verbs in one crew name. Is she stretching? Is she crushing? Bobby Fischer, where is he? I don’t know, I don’t know.

Any card with quotes about curling your toes probably isn’t a serious contender for statistical powerhouse, but even so, Crusher presents a pretty bland flavor profile. We’ll start with the highlight; a fantastic antimatter hit rate helps buoy a triple digit vRank debut into the company of last year’s voyage all-stars in the same skill set - Devious Duet Jurati and Night Terrors Troi. If you happened to miss them, passed on the collection magnet Pahvan, or haven’t been lucky with Simple Simon Van Gelder yet, Crusher could be an option to star up. The best ability is availability.

We’re significantly less bullish about Crusher elsewhere, however. While she’s had a few good event years recently, Crusher has been prone to extended stretches (hah) of irrelevance on weekends and her raw DIP base is not in an upper echelon of power that would be able to claim Faction seating without a bonus on most veteran rosters. With a subpar collection portfolio to boot, this is a card you’d want to either full fuse immediately to bolster your voyages or simply let her hog a crew slot for years to come.
