Easily the most flavourful of the Strange New Worlds crew to drop (he has quotations marks in his name!), Kyle debuts with the kind of Stats that would've turned heads in 2021, but this is 2022 - the year that hasn't so much changed the old guard, as booted them all out on their asses and left them holding their unemployment paperwork. 

Kyle is emblematic of this trend, sporting a good amount of power and even, rarely for WRG, an actually good Skill set, but lacking in Gauntlet or Event prowess, i.e. the power that sticks around long after creeping Stats have rendered your Tuesday Pack investments nothing but a cruel joke. For those of you looking to spend Legendary Citations on your hard won crew, be warned that WRG's current trajectory is hard to judge - the power could continue to flow, or it could be suddenly shut off in favor of a long, cold, CDS winter. 

Whether or not you'll be pleased with Citing Kyle up this time next year will very much depend on your gut feeling when I ask you if you think WRG will keep printing “Later Losers” Voyagers, because once his Voyage power shifts from great to merely good or okay, he doesn't have a ton else to hang his hat on outside of two very wide and common Collections. Oh, and the quotation marks.
