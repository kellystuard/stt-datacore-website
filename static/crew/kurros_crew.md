Kurros is a hell of a story teller, but his stats tell the true tale of limited use. Evasion on Ships better than his is not hard to find and although he has a handful of Trait Event possibilities, his weekend work will be erratic and undependable.

But if we take a trip down to the Collections panel, his value will be revealed like a jewel in a bed of fog. A few Collections already in hand, Kurros should be a “necessary” piece there for a long time, even if Collection expansions were to stop. With a handful of future options to add to that count, Kurros is Trait rich in exactly the way that late game Stat boost-chasing players love to see.
