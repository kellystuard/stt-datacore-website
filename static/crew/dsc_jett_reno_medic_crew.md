Tig Notaro’s debut as Jett Reno has been a fan favorite on Star Trek Discovery and this variant of that character has been a player favorite since its debut in a Tuesday Pack, then later as a global gift. Smart players Immortalized at least one copy of this crew and let her staff their Voyages for years, but sadly as we speak, her power has waned and her plus Skill Set including MED/ENG can no longer buoy her.

There is a silver lining to this card’s age, as Reno continued to pick up Collection after Collection, stacking five of them in quick succession. Don’t look for more, as her remaining Traits are too bloated to likely get a corresponding Collection.
