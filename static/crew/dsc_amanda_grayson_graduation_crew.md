As with many former Mega Event Recurring Legendary crew, be sure to take what your Fleetmates and Discord buddies say about Graduayson with a grain of salt; they likely got a decent amount of use from her on debut and for a time after. If you are seeing this crew for the first time now, caveat emptor. 

Amanda is little more than the sum of her Traits at this point, which isn’t bad, it’s just not great. A ceiling of five Collections, with four in hand at the time of this writing, gives her above average value there, and the associated bonus Events lets her common Skill set shine. Don’t rush to finish Amanda; let the stars trickle in.
