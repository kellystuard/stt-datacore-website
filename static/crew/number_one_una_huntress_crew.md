A banger of a Super Rare Crew from a banger of a Strange New Worlds episode, Huntress Z'ymira, Una Chin-Riley’s Elysian Kingdom nom de guerre, is a Crew we could only hope was of Legendary Rarity. 

Alas, even though new players would enjoy her on Voyages, due to a strong Skill set and order, it’s unlikely they would find four copies of her before they move on to using partially or fully-Fused Legendary Crew in most game modes. A delightful Trait list has borne its Collection fruit to the tune of three Stat-Boosters and one Vanity, and still has three more unsprouted.
