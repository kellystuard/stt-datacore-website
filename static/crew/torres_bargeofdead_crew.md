The second of two fantastic (on debut) Torres variants to arrive in short order, Dead’lanna stands head and shoulders above her older sister Orbital Skydiving Torres by delivering equally fantastic art, increased Voyage power, and an almost-as-attractive Skill set and order.

With enough debut raw power on Voyages to remain more than viable in that game mode almost 18 months after debut, Torres sits at the right hand of newer debut EV Suit Uhura in her triplet, and atop her own Skill order. A sexter of Antimatter seating chances lets her lend her Voyage power to your long sojourns in search of Voyage-Exclusive Legendary Beholds.

Torres Events are hit and miss throughout the game’s history, so we must turn to Trait-based Events for value, and there’s plenty there. Multiple past Mega Events, including recent a surprise month long Desperate bonus, give us hope for many more. A lower Collection ceiling than most perhaps is her only drawback, but her long-term value is in her Ship Ability, a 400% Instant Damage with an Accuracy Boost to help you hit your targets, and hard, Activating at six seconds with the usual Evasion Handicap.
