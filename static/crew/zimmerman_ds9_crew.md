A wonderful marriage of character story with in-game crew, Zimmerman takes getting rejected by Leeta so poorly that he voyages away from DS9 as far and as fast as possible - we reap the benefits. 

In(no)vader Zim debuted as a powerful Voyager with a whopping seven Antimatter Traits and frankly not much Skill set competition. However, Power Creep comes for them all and he’s fallen hard and fast, but still is a “Viable Voyager” since he enjoys very little competition in his Triplet and Skill Order.

The other cupboards aren't totally bare as his workman's pair of Bases should spot-fill daily Shuttles or even shine during the rare chances he gets at weekend work. If you don't mind the 'face color matches his clothing' aesthetic he shares with The Hansens, select Lewis in your Legendary Beholds at your leisure and collect his dual Collection inclusions, and have hope for two more.
