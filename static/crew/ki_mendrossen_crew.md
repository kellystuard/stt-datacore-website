Looking like the Mirror Universe good guy Bruce McGill doesn’t really help us ki in on what episode Mendrossen hails from. Hint: sash.

His ship ability closely mimics Super Rare Alandra La Forge’s from a few weeks past and her being an event reward certainly makes her offering the cheaper of the two. Factor in an equally redundant skill set and a crew who could be low ki useful on voyages thanks to a good power level ends up being better on paper than in practice thanks to his weekday pack entry point.

Despite a few green light attributes on his scorecard, his expensive pre-portal acquisition cost and redundant attributes are ki to tanking the value of a crew who would have been better served as an event reward or perhaps a boxing promoter yelling at Paul Giamatti about his broken down client. Pop-pop….Bang!
