Burnham on-the-rocks may find her usage across rosters somewhat rocky too. Power levels satisfactory for new rosters will bump against a skill set and DIP primary that are rarely in short supply and may hamper her day to day use into the mid-game. Nevertheless, fairly reliable Event utility and a fertile Trait set which has already sprouted five Collections (with maybe two more to come) should have her paying dividends for years to come.
