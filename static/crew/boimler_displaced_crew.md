RIKER!

Ok, first if you haven’t seen “Those Old Scientists”, stop reading this and go watch it! I’ll wait.



Hi, welcome back. Wasn’t that great?! Jack Quaid’s live action Brad Boimler is everything we could have dreamed of, and look, this crew art is both seated AND using a prop! A Recurring Mega Event Legendary that we’ve hopefully all earned, and worth the fifth star for Immortalize, watch him add a tick mark to a quartet of Collections and fly on your Voyages with enough requisite power and a good enough Skill set. His Primary Base is not ideal for Shuttles, being in the bottom half of the frequency of Seating, but when his name is called, look out!
