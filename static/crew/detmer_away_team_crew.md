A Detmer card? What year is it, 2019?

Emily Coutts/Detmer fans rejoice (there are dozens of us!)! The latest ultra-premium ÜberKampaign offering is EV Suit but labeled as Away Team Detmer – and she’s really quite good!

Offering a great Skillset of SEC/ENG/CMD, Detmer debuts high in the Voyage rankings, only seconded in her skill tree by some guy named Chances Taken Kirk, whoever that is. Detmer features eight Antimatter Trait matches and by the time she hits the Portal, will still be (hopefully) within the top 100 Voyage ranks. Don’t discount her high SEC Base, which will get you shuttles work – good thing she’s dressed for spacework.

If you’ve never had a 25% Hull Repair crew to put on your FBB ship – I’m guessing because you started the game yesterday and don’t have one of the other 65 healers, she will put in the work for you. Otherwise, you already have her ship ability covered.

Four Stat-Boosting collections with a few more down the line will help round out the the thought process on “Should I or Shouldn’t I Buy” – if you are looking for a Campaign to buy, this is one of the best releases they’ve had in months.
