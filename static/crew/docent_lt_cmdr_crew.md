This over-stressed and worn out officer is done being epic, and would love nothing more than to lead a simple life in this simple Star Trek game. Lucky for him, that’s exactly what he gets to do. One of the better Super Rare Voyagers out there, that’s pretty much all he’ll be called upon for for players whose rosters aren’t fleshed out with enough Legendaries just yet. For everyone else, he and his T-88 can retire gracefully to the Cryostasis Vault while adding a notch in the tough Animated Collection.
