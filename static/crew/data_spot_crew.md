This note was going to be an Ode To Spot-esque, thesaurus-snuggling review poem, but that’d be more effort than this crew deserves. I suppose, in a sense, Stats should matter less for a card tied to completing the Pet People Collection, but it’s still real to me, damnit!

For the cost of a dozen Legendary and sundry Super Rares, many of whom are not in the Time Portal (cash gated), you receive a crew who’s average in almost all respects. His highlight, a warm ENG Base, debuted alongside a monster #1 ENG Scotty who’s far easier to acquire from Fleet Boss Battles.

This dynamic duo certainly offers some day one usability, but as a Collection reward, and thus meant to be more like a day 500 crew for your average Joe, Data and Spot simply don’t have the staying power to be considered alongside the release versions of Scapegoat O’Brien or other various Exclusives as a crew to chase. Take the scenic route here and hug your Fluffy along the way.
