Featuring art that might make Melissa Navia cringe (I mean, I certainly would if someone put this out in a licensed product and said it was me), Off-Duty Ortegas is the textbook definition of six pack filler - strong in one area, but still utterly unessential. On the one hand, good for the wallet; on the other, it'd be nice if all crew could at least be good at more than one thing. While Gauntlet, the chosen area for her to excel in, is at least one that'll age well, the skill set, lack of crit traits, and relatively weak ENG kicker mean she'll never rise to true ubiquity. Locutus and Gowron, among others, will still rule the roost for the most part thanks to their A+ crit sets, and outside of another Gauntlet exclusive overlapping some of her skant trait set, it's unlikely this'll change in the near future. Everywhere else, she brings zip, zilch, and their good friend zippity-zap-nothing: the power just isn't there, and while Datacore may find a seat for her on the occasional Pilot or Crafty seat, you'd really be better off just seating, you know. Actually good crew.
