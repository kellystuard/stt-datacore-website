ðŸŽµRayna, you've got me on my knees.
Rayna, I'm begging, darling, please.
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?ðŸŽµ

Absolutely the inspiration for Mike Meyers when he created Fembots (*citation needed*...my research came up short here but also you canâ€™t prove Iâ€™m wrong so letâ€™s roll with it), Rayna experienced such a flood of emotion that she short-circuited. And letâ€™s face it, you would too if you had to choose between Flint and Kirk! You know whatâ€™s not a hard choice? Saving your Dilithium and not going after Rayna in a Six-Pack. Little to fuss about other than some Super Rare ENG Primary Voyaging, sheâ€™s best left to random drops or lucky Beholds in the future. For what itâ€™s worth, this is some damn fine art though. Oh behaveâ€¦
