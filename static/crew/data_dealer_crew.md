"Disoriented from being stuck in Jumanji for 26 years, Alan Parish questions the whereabouts of good crew and the current year." 

This slide begins with objectively awesome flavor text and descends rapidly afterwards. As one of SEVEN ENG primary Legendary Datae to grace the game, this gloomy Lurch look-alike is likely to be similarly window dressing for most players. A few tentpoles of good crew construction are in place (bankable Events, two Collections, two more viable Traits), but his power level is an anachronism - like almost all Legendary Datae, he is DOA on Voyages.

If you're a fan of his humorous scene, maybe you will find some use when his number is called for a variant Event or he is included in yet another WRG monthly “content update” AKA a new Collection. Just be aware that this action figure comes out of the box already a bit weathered.
