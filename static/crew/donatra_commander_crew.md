Besides being the best part of Nemesis, Donatra is a refreshingly valuable Romulan card that rises above bad Bases and Common Skills thanks to competitive Gauntlet pairs (top ten among Super Rares) and a trio of Stat-boosting Collections, plus Traits in her pocket for a pair more. If you happen upon her early, spend some resources to Fully Equip her for some Gauntlet use, and Fuse her from Beholds for the long term Collection-based value.
