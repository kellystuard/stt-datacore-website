Saru and T’Rina are a political juggernaut. Seriously, what a power couple. After matching his Vulcan fiancé in the use of logic in order to hop on a shuttle and head off Primarch Tahal, Ambassador Saru went toe-to-toe with the Breen leader in a game of high stakes diplomatic poker that showed he’s far more than just a pair of nice gams. Kitty has claws.

WIth a bevy of popular Event traits at his disposal, he’ll be hopping on Shuttles for you too. Furthermore, he’s going to have the chance to plug in to your ever rotating CMD/DIP Voyager roster, especially when your heavier hitters are out on their own Event assignments (it may be a bloated pairing, but that just means there’s always another crew ready to step up.). Not fast enough with his 400% Instant Damage to be of use for most players in Arena, and useless in Fleet Boss Battles thanks to his 2 shot Limit, his pen is perhaps mightier than his sword. The possibility of three more Collections down the road makes the Ambassador a decent investment both now and in the future, but falls short of being a must-have. Every politician has their faults, I suppose.
