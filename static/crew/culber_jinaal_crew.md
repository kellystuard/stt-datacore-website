“Wow, this guy really works out.” After that quote, a previous unzipping of his uniform, and this Firefighter Calendar pose, I’m honestly a bit shocked that Wilson Cruz didn’t go full Dr. Ian Malcolm and show some skin. Have you seen this guy’s Instagram?

This is a prime example of when a new crew being a Super Rare is much more welcoming than a Legendary. This particular Culber variant, being a Trill courtesy of the zhian'tara ritual, offers a somewhat easy-to-achieve notch in the difficult-to-complete Co-Existed Collection, especially if you earn copies through his debut Event Thresholds. If you are a newer player, he’s worth seeking out for his DIP Base and early game Voyaging potential too, as well as being one of the top Super Rare offerings for Shield Repair in Arena (sadly a three use limit does not extend this sentiment to Fleet Boss Battles).
