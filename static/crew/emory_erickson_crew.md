You'd think 'The Father of the Transporter' would be a more remarkable crew in Timelines. After all, Commander Trip "Charles" Tucker used to read his biography as a boy.

As he stands, no pun intended, Emory wasn’t much more than a Voyager on debut, and no pun intended, that ship has now sailed. As a former Campaign crew, a lot of players were probably able to realize that potential with four stars available in one go, so remember to look forward and not back when considering crew potential on Voyages.

With a shallow Trait list, he’s been lucky to capture the three Collections he has, and that Trait list does him no favors when it comes to possible Trait-based weekend bonuses. Maybe use him when he has a 45% Gauntlet for fun? I dunno.
