Alternate is a good way to describe a crew in Harry who's probably not coming off the bench any time soon. Thin Trait value won’t help boost uninspired daily numbers and while he’s had a more impressive Event history than you think, they’ve not historically helped him see much Faction Action. This card is low-end Behold filler to help you with a couple Collection notches.
