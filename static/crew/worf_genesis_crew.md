There's not much to unpack for Proto Worf. He's just what he looks like; a “screwdriver” crew who sits near the bottom of your toolbox. Despite being significantly less versatile than his big brother variants, Worf/Klingon Events will always have enough CMD/SEC seats to justify choosing this Primal in a pinch from a Legendary Behold. With a consistent Event pedigree and middling Collection value, he’s a name you’ll notice a couple times a year once Immortalized.
