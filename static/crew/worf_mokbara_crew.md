Don't let the Funko Pop head or the lack of color coordination between Worf's robes and shoes fool you, there's a card of value to be found here. In the olden days, this was the kind of variant that WRG might well have put into the world as a two-Skiller and let stand as a pure Event piece, but in 2022, two-Skillers are all but dead, and so we have a somewhat confusing SCI Tertiary bolted on - it's been a long time since I've heard tell of the science of ass kicking, but if anyone was going to be acquainted, it would be Worf.

While the SEC/DIP pairing may look somewhat vanilla and the scene may have called for MED instead of SCI, WRG have managed to instead provide a hearty mint, or perhaps a kind of weaker sour apple. Maybe one of those really nice vanilla ice creams, where it actually tastes of something and you remember it doesn't just mean bland. Whipping out a hearty SEC Base that puts all the other Wharves to shame (though BigBook.app hastens to add that it's not the size, it's how you use it that counts), it'll be easy to leverage Bases like these across Worf's consistent variant Events, and the raw Base means he'll perform admirably on non-bonus Shuttles if that's your bag.

For the Collection fiends among us, he has acquired three so far - and hey, you come back here! Get back here and eat your greens, it can't all be Tuxedo Nogs and Borg Queens. Of his other Traits, two are of the right size, niche appeal, and Collection saleability to feel like they might hit, so the jury is out on how good you're going to feel about having finished Worf this time next year when we've had another twelve notches added to the Collections tab.

On Voyages, the prospects are a little less rosy, given his age. That being said, a little bit of SEC/SCI never hurt anybody, and this exact permutation of Skills has been in need of a refresh for some time, so if you like a bit of flexibility on your Voyage seating, or just want to run the much vaunted all-Worf Voyage, he'll put in the work. All told, a well rounded crew - just make sure that the next time art like this drops, you too pass your gik'tal, and speak up at being unfairly treated.
