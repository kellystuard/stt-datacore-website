The latest supplementary Discovery bridge crew to get an additional inclusion on Timelines, Rhys is a middle of the road Super Rare crew, which is fitting because the character is of middle of the road interest to viewers. A common refrain among Discovery viewers is “Which one is Rhys?” and we have no answer other than… this guy? 

New players will welcome a serviceable Voyage score in a common Skills set, and all players will enjoy tick marks on his four Collections, with an investment in the future via at least one additional viable Trait. If you need some Crit Bonus on your Ship that has a Position Ability, you can throw him on there, otherwise throw him in Cryostasis after his Event.
