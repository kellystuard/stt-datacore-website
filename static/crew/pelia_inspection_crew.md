TP bafflingly loves to do this - release a crew and immediately invalidate their voyage/gauntlet/arena usefulness. In this case, Peliaâ€™s voyage ability, which accounts for roughly 100% of her value, is dominated by the contemporaneously debuting Subspace Rhapsody Pike. He covers five of her antimater seats outright and offers superior power and utility. With packs being the crapshoot they are, the campaign offering Pike is arguably the cheaper option as well.

Although there was room to flesh out that particular skill order, the CMD/DIP/ENG set itself has had plenty of movement over the last few years. If Pelia had been an event reward the week before, the situation might be more frustrating. As it stands, that decision makes Pelia an easy pass as a pack temptation as a crew who will not age well.
