Phlox variants will likely never be Event horses, so even though EV Suit’s Base metrics are strong for a Super Rare, he is hurt by limited seating options for daily Shuttles and Event bonuses on the weekend. One of the first names to thaw when he does snag a bonus, there may be certain years where that doesn’t happen much if at all, at least for Faction action.

But the good news picks up from there. Servicable Voyage metrics even a while after his debut offer usability for early-to-midgame rosters and as an early adopter to the Collection bonanza, he comes pre-loaded with most of his Traits already bearing fruit. New players will take him for the daily work, veterans for the Collections, and we can all smile like Phlox himself. Optimism, Captain!
