An old crew who's popped up as a giveaway multiple times in the past, if you're one of those players who have a few stars on him already, don't feel bad about tacking one more on. A fairly strong Trait set has performed admirably for Event opportunities thus far and grants him a worthwhile mix of immediate and potential Collection value, with a possible cap at five.
