This Tucker variant has so much going for him (art, traits, stats, skills) that we genuinely wish he was a Legendary instead. Some of that value, such as his voyage capability, will end up blunted when run up against those five star options, but he has utility to spare.

Strong base meets strong event tally to grant Trip some thawpertunities on most rosters while his collection portfolio is an automatic acquisition for veteran players. With Ardra-lite arena work and his aforementioned voyage power, Dawn Tucker is a complete package with something to offer every roster. Weâ€™re down with DTT.
