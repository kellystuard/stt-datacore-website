Humans as katra vessels is a tale as old as spacetime. From Sarek to Burnhman, from Spock to Chapel, and most notably from Spock to McCoy, it’s been a bit of a hidden Vulcan cheat code. Technically speaking, Surak to Archer (by way of Syrran) started it all.

Spray Tan Archer (ok, fine, I’ll accept that the torch is casting light on his face from close distance), is, perhaps fittingly, by far his strongest SCI variant we have. However, BigBase™ fans beware, being solidly in the Top 10 overall here is also a mere 25 unboosted points away from not even being in the Top 35. The good news is that while crew like this are interchangeable on daily shuttles, they each have their own traits and variant name, giving you another tool in your Eventing toolbox. Heck, thanks to a dual species designation he’s even the top Vulcan SCI option as he goes live! As one might expect, this helps build his solid five Stat-Boosting Collection resume, which can very well expand to seven or eight before this game’s own living spirit takes root in a human. My bet is on Frank.
