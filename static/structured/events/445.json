However, there are too many who would benefit from things staying as they are and they are ready to put up the fight of their lives.","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each contest: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance for the contest.\n-- Using Henoch Spock, any version of Seven, Howard, O'Brien, or Compromised crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the Borg Tactical Cube, Harrad-Sar's Barge, the Borg Sphere, or ships with the Borg trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Borg (Ship trait), Henoch Spock, Seven, Howard, O'Brien, or Compromised","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_ve_youcanneverescape.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":26436,"symbol":"toreth_crew","name":"Toreth","full_name":"Toreth","flavor":"Toreth’s long-standing distrust of the Tal Shiar raises the stakes on an intense mission to smuggle defectors to the Federation without her knowledge.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_toreth_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_toreth_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_toreth_full"},"skills":{"command_skill":{"core":73,"range_min":22,"range_max":46},"security_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":17,"range_max":34},"engineering_skill":{"core":31,"range_min":8,"range_max":31}},"traits":["romulan","tactician","desperate","brutal","duelist","veteran","vengeful"],"action":{"bonus_amount":3,"name":"I Demand an Explanation","symbol":"toreth_action","cooldown":6,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":12,"bonus_type":0,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":26436,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_toreth_icon"},"ability":{"condition":1,"type":0,"amount":4},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":26434,"symbol":"felisa_howard_possessed_crew","name":"Felisa","full_name":"Possessed Felisa Howard","flavor":"During her lifetime, Felisa had a lover, Ronin, who was an anaphasic creature and who possessed her exhumed corpse.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_felisa_howard_possessed_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_felisa_howard_possessed_sm"},"rarity":4,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_felisa_howard_possessed_full"},"skills":{"medicine_skill":{"core":50,"range_min":28,"range_max":29},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":38,"range_min":11,"range_max":39},"science_skill":{"core":21,"range_min":6,"range_max":12}},"traits":["human","civilian","spiritual","communicator","caregiver","romantic","compromised"],"action":{"bonus_amount":6,"name":"Have Trust In Me","symbol":"felisa_howard_possessed_action","cooldown":8,"initial_cooldown":10,"duration":6,"bonus_type":0,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":26434,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_felisa_howard_possessed_icon"},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":23779,"symbol":"obrien_paranoid_crew","name":"O'Brien","full_name":"Paranoid O'Brien","flavor":"O’Brien was replaced with a clone to derail the peace talks.
