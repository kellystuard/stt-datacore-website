After the mission is complete, that crew will be disabled from doing Specialist Missions for some period of time.\n-- Specialist Missions take time to complete. The higher selected crew skills are the less time it will take them to complete a mission.\n-- Using crew with matching Specialist Mission bonus traits will significantly decrease time needed to complete a mission.\n-- Each time a Specialist Mission is completed, some progress is also gained on the Main Mission. Completing the Main Mission rewards substantial amounts of Event Victory Points.\n-- The featured crew for this event are: Emmet, Alandra La Forge, Flustered Jett Reno.\n-- Using any version of Emmet, A. La Forge, Reno, or Federation crew will provide a chance to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission.\n-- You earn Event Victory Points each time you complete a Specialist Mission or the Main Mission.
