Stop her!","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using Moll, any version of Ruhn, L'ak, Airiam, or Discovery crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the U.S.S. Discovery, the Booker's Ship, the Constitution Class Ship, or ships with the Federation trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Federation (Ship trait), Moll, Ruhn, L'ak, Airiam, or Discovery","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_ve_finishline.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":26748,"symbol":"mariner_detective_crew","name":"Mariner","full_name":"Detective Mariner","flavor":"Of all the holoprograms on the Cerritos, why did Boimler have to fire up this one?
