But if the Federation still has custody of the recently recovered Voyager-J, who is at the helm of this one? And why is the journey to reach it increasingly more deadly?","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using Gul Evek, any version of Ayala, Q, Kim, or Voyager crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the Borg Cube, the U.S.S. Voyager NCC-74656-J, the Intrepid-Class Ship, or ships with the Transwarp trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Transwarp (Ship trait), Gul Evek, Ayala, Q, Kim, or Voyager","rewards_teaser":"translation missing: en.event_ve_adrift.rewards_teaser","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":27414,"symbol":"neelix_scavenger_crew","name":"Neelix","full_name":"Scavenger Neelix","flavor":"Neelixâ€™s six years of experience on a Talaxian garbage scow, including almost dying when theta radiation disabled the ship, may be just what the Voyager crew needs.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_neelix_scavenger_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_neelix_scavenger_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_neelix_scavenger_full"},"skills":{"engineering_skill":{"core":73,"range_min":44,"range_max":46},"security_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":17,"range_max":34},"command_skill":{"core":41,"range_min":8,"range_max":31}},"traits":["talaxian","mylean","civilian","communicator","survivalist","desperate","tactician"],"action":{"bonus_amount":5,"charge_phases":[{"charge_time":2,"ability_amount":18000},{"charge_time":4,"ability_amount":20000}],"name":"We've Got To Keep Moving","symbol":"neelix_scavenger_action","cooldown":8,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":8,"bonus_type":2,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":27414,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_neelix_scavenger_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":5,"amount":15000},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":27347,"symbol":"q_chokuzan_crew","name":"Q","full_name":"Chokuzan Q","flavor":"After his son leaves Voyager for a joyride, Q takes on the guise of a Chokuzan to test Q Jr.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_q_chokuzan_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_q_chokuzan_sm"},"rarity":4,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_q_chokuzan_full"},"skills":{"security_skill":{"core":50,"range_min":14,"range_max":29},"engineering_skill":{"core":38,"range_min":21,"range_max":39},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":21,"range_min":11,"range_max":21}},"traits":["q","crafty","playful","desperate","pilot","tactician","undercover_operative"],"action":{"bonus_amount":5,"name":"Well Done, Junior.
